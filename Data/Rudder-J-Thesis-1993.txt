      PREFACE.

               The data on which this thesis is based were obtained largely during the
course of 12 months of fieldwork in North East Arnhem Land between November
1988 and July 1989, then from May to August in 1990. Apart from brief periods,
totalling about six weeks at Yirrkala the rest of the research was carried out at
Galiwin'ku. However it is also the culmination of a much longer period of learning
from the Yo!vu, a process which began in 1964 with residence at Yirrkala for three
years, and following that at Galiwin'ku for ten years from 1967 to 1977. During
that time I was interested in and learning about the Yo!vu world, but it was only

during the twelve months of field work that I was able to give my whole attention
to the task.


               My original intention for the fieldwork was to simply sit down with the
old men, record from them data on ideas of time, space and the physical and
spiritual worlds and then to produce ·a descriptive analysis of the Yo!vu Cosmos
from that. While I knew that some of the old men had died during my ten years'
absence, I had not realised how few were left, nor how fragile their health had
become. Any time that they were able to give me was very precious. In practice a

new generation was replacing them and most of these men and women also had
very full lives. Those who made time to share with me their knowledge and their
thoughts did so out of schedules that were extremely full, and they did this on the

1-is of friendship rather than as paid informants. They taught me the absolute
centrality to Yolvu cosmology of the notions of relationships, and they instructed

me on the contrasts between "your" ideas of change and "our" ideas of
changelessness and transformation. In addition to this a number of men shared
with me ideas associated with the Morning Star, a myth/ritual complex that is
shared by most of the Dhuwa clans of Arnhem Land. In particular these included

WaQ&ymu from the ljaymil, Dji,niyini and Dauataua from the Golumala and the
two old Djambarrpu~u men who have since died. When I visited Yirrkala,
Daymbalipu from the Djapu and Witiyana's father from the Rirratjq,u added to this.

            I am in debt to a whole generation of older leaders from both Yirrkala
and Galiwin'ku, for their continuous patient instruction. In particular the ritual
leaders of the Rirratjq,u and Dhalw~u people from Yirrkala and of the Gilpu,
Djambarrpu~u and Wangurri at Galiwin'ku. In particular Djonpum, Galpagalpa

and Bagaltja.The majority of them are no longer with us. The new generation of
leaders, living in an almost totally different world from their parents, have been
able to show me that they see it as still the same world. Not only those people I
have mentioned above, but also Djal~gi and his mother, father and brothers,
Mawunydjil, Maratja and Guruwanawuy, Neparll)a and Dj~wuy, Da~mbu
and Rrurrambu; have all made valuable contributions, as have Daypurryun 2,
Bunbatjun, Rron~ and Ganhdhuwuy . In addition to these I have been much
helped by Rmkminy aJ.ld Yurranydjil, B~ydji and D~bm, Guthadjaka,
ljlndama and Gapany, Guyw~a, M&mJanyin and Ganyinunu. People with great
insight, understanding and knowledge. These lists cannot include all the names, nor
can they express the depth of relationships and feelings involved. They can only
give an indication of of the breadth of the North East Arnhem Land community
who have had input into the finished product.

            One of the new generation of leaders said to me in a public meeting,
"We have taught you, we would like you to teach your people the true story about

us". If this thesis can make a step towards fulfilling that expectation I am thankful.

            As far as discussion of ~ything secret within this thesis, I have not
knowingly disclosed anything that should not be told, and I have not included
photos of anything that cannot be seen by women and children. However, by the

time this is written it is possible for information declared as open to me to have

become restricted since then, and there is no way of knowing this. In any case, all
references to religious content and thought need to be handled with respect. Without

                                               iv
including what I have, there would only be a shadow of the richness of Yotuu
thought As it is, what I have written is more an indication, and a skimming of the

surface than a rull expression.

            My fieldwork and some of the time for the development of this thesis
have been supported by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Studies, and the rest has been supported by my wife Trixie. Without this
support it would not have been possible.

            Many non-Aboriginal people have encouraged, supported and prodded
me during the course of fieldwork To all of them I express my thanks. Specific
mention must be made of the late Dianne Buchanan, linguist and long time
supporter who, with her co-worker Margaret, helped to keep me in a reasonable
state of sanity while I was away from home and family. At both Yirrkala and

Galiwin'ku the members of M.A.F. were a great help as were the teachers at both
schools, especially Michael Christie at Yirrkala.

            Last, but not least, I need to thank Ian Keen, whose reading and re-
reading of successive drafts provoked me to think through issues and present them
clearly, without imposing another mould on me than my own. As for the diagrams,
illustrations, photos and typing, I am responsible except where acknowledged.

          ABSTRACT.

                This thesis is first and foremost a descriptive ethnography of the
    cosmology of the Yoq,u people who live in the North East Arnhem Land region of
    the Northern Territory of Australia. Supplementary to that description it explores
    the relationship between the Yo~u presupposition of changelessness, the rapidly
    changing world in which they live and their cosmology.

                The thesis is divided into four sections. The first briefly explores the
    theoretical frameworks to which it relates in terms of the literature on cosmology
    and world view, presupposition and the taken-for-granted, and extends into an
    introductory discussion of the Yo~u understandings of the area of thought
    frequently referred to in English as the spiritual, the metaphysical, or the
    supernatural. The second section examines human relationships, first from a
    diachronic perspective and secondly from a synchronic one. The third examines
    two conceptual areas which relate most closely to Western notions of cosmology in
    an examination of the Yoq,u notions of space and time. Finally the various themes
    of the thesis are drawn together in two ways. First in an examination of their

    application in a myth-ritual complex called Banumbirr (the Morning Star) and last
    of all in an analysis of the ways in which the Morning Star complex, together with
    the peztq>tions of relationships, of space, of time and of the supernatural combine
    to piesent a corporate model of a cosmos which, while seen to be not changing is

    structuml in such a way as to be able to incorporate change within changelessness.


I               This is an examination of cosmology in a changing world,

I   presuppositions of changelessness, and the present Yoq,u responses to change. In
    examining these, it provides as a by-product, a foundation for the study of the

I   effects of future change on cosmology and presuppositions, and a means by which
    these may be assessed.

            INTRODUCTION.
            THB YOL?'i1J OF NORTH EAST
            ARNHEM LAND.

            This thesis is focussed on the cosmological understandings of the
people of North East Arnhem Land, a people who have been given a variety of
names in the earlier Anthropological literature, but who are currently called the
Yoliju (lit. person). The central problem considered is how they as a people are
able to live in a world that is constantly changing around them and assert
categorically that the world does not change. This fundamental problem raises other
separate issues such as,

            1. How is change understood?

            2. What kind of world or cosmos is perceived to exist? How is it
structured and how do humans relate to it?
            3. How is identity structured and how are diachronic relations
understood and managed?
            4. In what ways are the everchanging patterns of human distribution
over the land interpreted and controlled?
            5. How is time understood?

            Each of these supplementary problems forms the basis for the
discussion in separate chapters; however before considering them further, I need to
provide a brief introduction to the people themselves and to their world, and give
an overview of the theoretical framework in which this thesis is set.

            The Yoliju speak a number of distinct languages most of which are
represented by several dialects. While I counted twenty-one separately named
dialects that were claimed to be spoken on Elcho Island, it is possible that th~e
may have been as many as forty or even more spread across North East Arnhem


                                               1
                                                             Chapter 1. - Introduction.

Land. The Yoliju group these dialects according to the word used for" this", and
name the groups by that word with the addition of a genitive suffix. Thus there are
the dbuwalamirri, dbuwalmirr, dha.gumi, dja.gumi, and several others (see Figure
4.19) forming an enclave of pama-nyungan speakers whose neighbours are all
non-pama-nyungan. While each of the dialect groups is affiliated with one or more
territorial location, there is a generally recognised grouping of the people into five
major and usually overlapping groups according to the location of their homelands.
These, shown in Map 1; 1, also overlap most linguistic groupings. Map 1.2, gives
some idea of the major Yoltlu centres and the outside centres with which they have
regularcontact

            The local history and prehistory involves a continuous record of
change and of contact with outsiders. The mythology records some who were
Yoliju innovators, but also refers to contact over a long period with Indonesian
trepang fishermen who came in quite large numbers from Makassar in the Celebes.
Since their visits were officially terminated by the Australian Government in 1906
there have been contacts with Japanese pearlers and more recently, white
Australians in continuously greater numbers. Prior to World War II these white
Australians were mainly missionaries and the occasional administrator. During the
war there were many new experiences, including allied air force bases along the
coast, and Japanese bombing raids. In addition a small number of men from a wide
group of clans were formed into a Special Reconnaissance Unit of the Australian
Army by the anthropologist Donald Thomson.1

            Starting in the 1930s but particularly after the war, there was a
spontaneous movement of people towards centres along the coast that were
established mostly by missionaries from the Methodist Overseas Missions. These
became centres for obtaining goods, and centres of refuge from

the continuous feuding between clans. This continued until the 1960s when the
people began·to feel that their sacred sites and clan lands were being threatened by
the activities of mining companies. At that point there began a move by a number
of clan groups to establish what have been called homeland centres on their own
land. partly in the attempt to restabilise families and partly to protect the land from
other occupation by demonstrating that it was occupied in a way that white
Australians could understand.

              Throughout the mission period Elcho Island was unique in a number of
ways. First the founding missionaries, Harold Shepherdson and his wife, had
already had a long term of service in the district before setting up the mission at
Elcho. They remained as the mission grew to a town, now called Galiwin'ku, and
then stayed until the authority for running the town was completely transferred into
Aboriginal hands. Sheppie, as he was known, was an engineer, not a clergyman,
and as such sought to build an economically viable community as one of the first
priorities, working on the principle that people who would not work received no
hand outs. Initially he established a sawmill to produce cypress pine building
timbers for Elcho and the other missions, then as staff increased, started a boat
building industry, a fishing industry, extensive market gardens and an engineering
workshop to suppott and supply all of these. His wife was in charge of the initial
medical work, and started the first school at the mission.

              While the Makassan contact had been an annual affair for many years it
was only for a limited number of months each year and did not seriously alter the
traditional lifestyle2, even though a large number of Makassan words were
incorporated into the language and a considerable effect has been made on content
of the Yirritja Moiety ceremonial systems. With the coming of the missions there




2 Throughout this thesis I use the word "traditional" to refer to practices which appear to have
been active or retained from pre-mission times or prior to white contact.

began a gradually increasing change to a sedentary lifestyle, a dependence on
manufactured goods and on foods that were produced by commercial means.
Shepherdson saw these changes as being inevitable but encouraged people to stay
on their own land. He built a plane, learned to fly, and encouraged the people to
build rough airstrips at their community centres so that he could bring out to them
some of the basic requirements in exchange for goods which ranged from craft
work to crocodile skins. Cypress logs were also brought back to Elcho from some
coastal centres by fishing boats. Thus when the movement towards re-establishing
homeland centres began from the other Arnhem Land Missions there were centres
all around Elcho that had never been completely unoccupied.

             Shepherdson's style of government appears to have been a limited form
of paternalism in that he attempted to involve senior men in the management of
what might be termed aspects of the community that were outside normal
Aboriginal cultural norms. With this he combined an endeavour to maintain senior
Aboriginal men in positions of authority, in the aspects of community life which
appeared to be relevant to Aboriginal community life3.

             In 1957 the Elcho Aboriginal elders arranged what Berndt has
described as an adjustment movement. This appears to have been a completely
Aboriginal movement which involved the exposure of a number of ceremonial
objects which it had previously been forbidden for women to see. These were
cemented into what has been termed the Elcho Island Memorial (Berndt 1988:50).
The apparent idea behind the action was to establish an equality between the
Aboriginal and white communities and perhaps also to bridge the gaps between
Christian and Aboriginal religions and between traditional and community values
and life styles.




3 This was not wholly successful. Leadership of Western structures eventually fell into the hands
of younger men who understood more English and had more familiarity with Western
administration than the senior men (See Rudder 1979)

             Since autonomous Aboriginal authority was established, there have
been a number of further changes. The mission staff, recruited by the United
Church, which at its highest number (including children) was over 100, has now
reduced to two who work as a lay staff of the local parish under the supervision of
the Aboriginal pastor. The school is staffed by government teachers, and the
hospital by health department, although staff are selected by the Aboriginal council,
and most other non-Aboriginal staff are employed by the Aboriginal Galiwin 'ku
Community Inc. Council, or the Marthakal Outstations council.

             The most significant recent factor of change that I am aware of is what
has been termed "The Galiwin'ku Revival". This was a movement which began
spontaneously amongst the YolIJu and has been described by Robert Bos (1987).
One of the more recent outcomes of this movement has been visits by groups of
YolIJu to Israel.

            Many of the issues mentioned in this brief historical overview will be
dealt with more fully in later chapters, as I discuss the ways YolIJu comprehend
their world, the cosmology they have developed, and the ways in which changing
circumstances have affected it. The theoretical framework of this analysis to which
I now turn includes an examination of the notions of cosmos and cosmology as
they are used throughout later chapters, and is followed by an introduction to some
of the YolIJu concepts critical to the later analysis.

             APPROACH TO ANALYSIS.

             As I have examined the questions outlined in the first paragraph of this
thesis and as I have sought to learn the answers to them proposed by YolIJu men
and women, I have attempted to find a useful theoretical framework within which
both analysis and discussion could be developed. This has involved a progression
through a series of different anthropological approaches. The foundation for my
research was laid with a combination of structural and cognitive studies. In this I
                                                                Chapter 1. - Introduction.

took an approach related to that described by Beals (1977:594) as he outlined what
he saw as cognitive anthropology.

            (S)uch differences as exist between human beings in ways of thinking
      or cognition are to be attributed to the kinds of information received through
      the senses, to the selection of information for storage in the memory, and to
      learned ways of processing information. Perception or the selection of
      information to be remembered or processed depends upon the importance
      attributed to particular sorts of information and upon the availability of such
      information within the environment. What people think and how they think
      about it presumably is related to the kinds of experiences they have had as
      members of a particular culture and as speakers of a particular language. The
      anthropological study of cognition has to do with the exploration of
      differences in ways of thinking and perceiving that are characteristic of the
      members of different cultures. ·

             I examined as well as I could the ways in which Yoluu process the
"information received through the senses" and the structures used in doing this.
Pursuing such a cognitive approach facilitated the analysis of classificatory and
cognitive systems.4 However while this approach to analysis produced what
appeared to be sound results, I was left with unanswered questions associated with
the filters affecting the ways in which the information was being processed, and
with identifying the underlying causes or patterns controlling these "differences in
ways of thinking and perceiving" referred to by Beals.

             Such unanswered questions led to an examination of aspects of Yoluu
semantics and symbolism and to the combination of these with structural analysis
as I sought to uncover the structures of the Yoiuu symbolic systems. I considered
the significance of symbolism as portrayed in some of the literatures where it
appeared to be argued that symbolism was the determining factor in human culture
and that the symbolic codes and systems of signs once established, shaped the
information that was held and the way it was added to, thus structuring the thought
and hence by implication, the actions of the group. This argument, though well

S As for example in Dolgin (et al 1977:6)

            supported, did not appear to go far enough for they gave no real basis for the
            analysis of how those symbolic codes came to be established. I was again left with
            questions as to what factors could be discovered as laying a foundation upon
            which such symbolic codes and systems might become established.

    l
                        Thus in attempting to use each of these separate anthropological
            approaches, I have been pushed, by the data and these unanswered questions into a
    l       single direction. That is, to search for factors which could be considered to have
    I
            shaped or to have strongly influenced the structures of the cognitive, semantic and
            symbolic codes by means of which the Yoluu cosmos is constructed.

                        This led me finally to an examination of one aspect of analysis which is
            frequently referred to in the literature but which seems to have rarely been given
            either a central place or to have been subjected to an in depth analysis. That is, to a
            consideration of the place of existential presuppositions or assumptions about the
            nature o(existence and the relationship between such presuppositions and the
            establishment of cultural patterns, symbolic codes and practice.

                        The problems associated with the place of assumptions within a
            cultural or social system appear to have been considered to some extent by Douglas
            (1973 and 1975) Ortner (1984) and Bourdieu (1977). Douglas suggests (1975:3,4)
            that there is some infonnation which she refers to as "self-evident", which does not
            require to be justified and that remaining implicit it forms "a stable background on
            which more coherent meanings are formed". This information she says, is "too true
        I
        I   to warrant discussion", and "provides the necessary unexamined assumptions upon
        l
        i   which ordinary discourse takes place." She also suggests, with regard to these
        1   background assumptions, that it is through "these implicit channels of meaning,

        I   human society is achieved, clarity and speed of clue-reading ensured".

        I               While examining Lele cosmology (1975:28) Douglas makes the claim
            that "the broad framework of assumptions about animals and humans ...... are so


                                                            9

fundamental to Lele thought that one could almost describe them as unformulated

categories through which they unconsciously organise their experiences". And

again (1975:35), "Lele religion is based on certain assumptions about the inter-

relation of humans, animals, and spirits". In drawing these observations together

she suggests that (1975:51) "the scheme or structure of assumptions" acts as a

framework for the organisation and assimilation of new experiences, with each

such action serving to validate and strengthen the scheme of assumptions by which

it was structured. Conversely, where an experience is unfamiliar, its

accommodation may lead to the modification of the scheme of assumptions.

Throughout this discussion, Douglas seems to be implying that it is on the basis of

assumptions about the cosmos that the framework of perception is established and

hence that assumptions play a determining role in the perception of the cosmos.


            Ortner (1984: 153) appears to arrive at almost the same position in

discussing the relationship between practice and the "system" (which for her

appears to mean the overall cultural system). She says first that,

             there seems to be general agreement that action is constrained most
      deeply and systematically by the ways in which culture controls the
      definitions of the world for actors, limits their conceptual tools, and restricts
      their emotional repertoires.


            Having then noted that the definition of the world is culturally

constrained, she arrives at questions about the role of assumptions, though she

phrases these somewhat differently (p 155),

            One question lurking behind all of this is whether in fact all practice,
      everything everybody does, embodies and hence reproduces the assumptions
      of the system. There is a profound philosophical issue here: how if the actors
      are fully cultural beings, could they ever do anything that does not in some
      way carry forward core cultural assumptions. On the more mundane level,
      the question comes down to whether divergent or nonnormative practices are
      simply variations upon basic cultural themes, or whether they actually imply
      alternative modes of social and cultural being.


            She suggests that where change occurs as a result of class struggle and

a different group assumes dominance, that change is related to a difference in the

"ways of seeing and organising the world" which are associated with the new


                                               10
                                                             Chapter 1. - Introduction.

dominant group. Her use of "ways of seeing and organising the world" and her
"system" and "culture" appear to mean very much the same thing as each other and
to be very close to my own definition of "cosmology" outlined in the section which
follows this. However in her questioning about the relations between practice and
the assumptions of the systems she is raising not one question,. but by implication,
a series of them. These can be phrased as follows;

            What is the relation between system, practice and assumption?
            Do assumptions play a determining role?

            Is variation in practice possible without variation in assumptions?
            Does a change in assumption impose a change in practice or in the
system?

            Within these questions there is Ortner's own assumption that there is
something that is agreed upon in common by a whole group of people which is a
manifestation of their group identity. In this case Ortner is specifically referring to a
"system" which incorporates a set of assumptions and this is very close to if not
the same as the conclusion reached by Douglas, both discussions at one point
being able to be reduced to the considerations of the relationships between a set of
assumptions corporately held and a world which is to some extent at least,
corporatelyperceived.

            In the development of his theory of practice, Bourdieu (1977) appears

to come close to these same questions. He introduces two terms, habitus and doxa,

linking each of them to elements that he describes as "taken for granted". Because
this phrase can be used to mean "assumption" or "presupposition" it would be a
simple matter to conclude that he is considering the same things as I am in his use
of these terms. However habitus as he defines it is a strategy generating principle
almost indistinguishable from ethos, but which he says is developed as a habitual
pattern of responding to various situations out of a history of pragmatic choices of
action to gain optimum advantage. This habitus once formed is then described as


                                               11
                                                              Chapter 1. - Introduction.

being a disposition or inclination to act in a particular way (p214) and as taking a
determining role in the way members of a group respond to situations (p76-78). It
is "taken for granted" as the right way to respond to a situation, that is, based on
assumptions about the most effective ways to act to achieve the desired results.
Thus the "taken for granteds" associated with habitus are assumptions associated
with a group's characteristic responses to situations, that is, their practice and are
not primarily assumptions associated with the nature of the group or the nature of
its world.

             Bourdieu ( 1977: 164) continuing his discussion, identifies a second
"taken for granted" by the term "doxa". This he refers to as the "taken for granted"
nature of the naturalness (and hence rightness) of the structures of social relations
of dominance, in which the dominating and dominated groups accept these
structures without consideration that there could be an alternative. This relationship
he says, is supported by the structures of the natural world as it is perceived and as
it appears to parallel and prove the naturalness or rightness of the relations between
humans. This is his doxic relationship where the assumptions that he is considering
are those associated with the practices, and with the unchallenged and
unchallengeable structures of dominance involved in those practices.

             Thus doxa as a term identifies one particular kind or category of
existential assumption; that a~sociated with the nature of the structures of the
relations of dominance in any particular society. As such I consider it to be
focussed on a narrow domain as far as existential assumptions are concerned being
restricted to only one aspect of the presuppositions about the nature of the cosmos,
and I will only consider it incidently to the main direction of this thesis.

             There is a distinction between core and non-core assumptions that is
implied in the problem raised by Ortner though not explicitly stated. In considering
the second half of the problem she raised, of whether there are possibilities of
alternatives modes within a single culture or whether such an alternative mode is to

                                                12
                                                               Chapter 1. - Introduction.

 be considered as non-normative appears to me to be related to whether such non-
 normative practices are related to a change in the core assumptions or not. Ortner
 raises this issue again (1984:14) without offering a solution, when she says that
              the central problem for practice theory is, as all its practitioners seem to
       agree, precisely the question of how actors who are so much products of
       their own social and cultural context can ever come to transform the
       conditions of their own existence, except by accident.

              There is then a further problem associated with the relationship
 between assumptions and other aspects of a cultural system where a situation of
 change occurs, which can be formulated in the question, "Does a change in the
 environment cause a change in either cosmological assumptions or in the
 perception of the cosmos, and if so how?" This is a problem for which I do not
 have adequate space in this thesis to give a thorough examination, though I will
 touch it briefly in later discussion.

              Chalmers (1976:92) attempts to give an answer to such a question in a
. discussion of Thomas Kuhn's (1962nO) work, suggesting that there is a
 relationship between a change in assumption and a change in practice, which
 involves a radical "conversion" type experience.
            The change of allegiance on the part of individual scientists from one
       paradigm to an incompatible alternative is likened by Kuhn [l 970]to a 'gestalt
       switch' or a 'religious conversion.'

             Douglas has suggested (1975:76) that paradigm is "Kuhn's expression
 for a set of scientific assumptions based on a crucial well-established piece of
 research" This being so it is possible to interpret Kuhn as arguing that a change in
 cosmological assumption requires an experience that conflicts radically with those
 assumptions to the point where those assumptions are no longer compatible with
 experience and are radically changed. This would agree with Chalmer's further
 suggestion (1976:92) that,
             There will be no purely logical argument that demonstrates the
       superiority of one paradigm over another and that thereby compels a rational
       scientist to make the change.[From one to another].

                 The relationship between such paradigm change and this "gestalt
     switch" or "religious conversion" will be indicated briefly later in this thesis,
     together with the relation between such changes and core assumptions, which from
     this point on I will refer to as presuppositions. It is necessary first however to
     consider the relation between these things and "Yol:uu cosmology" which forms
     the focus of this thesis.

                 COSMOLOGY, WORLD VIEW AND CHANGE.

                 I have taken as a basic definition of cosmology a combination of those
     given by the Encyclopaedia Brittanica and the Oxford English Dictionary. The
     definition given by the Dictionary says that cosmology is
                the science or theory of the universe as an ordered whole, and of the
           general laws which govern it. Also a particular account or system of the
           universe and its laws.

                 This is a definition which relates very closely to Chalmer's use of
     "theory" in his discussion of the theory of science (1976). The Encyclopaedia
     describes cosmology as
                  that framework of concepts and relations which man erects, in
           satisfaction of some emotional or intellectual drive, for the purpose of
           bringing descriptive order into the world as a whole, including himself as one
           of the elements.

     By combining these definitions with an acknowledgement that cosmology is a
     human construction, the definition that develops is broad but practical. That is,
I!
     Cosmology is the theory of the universe as an ordered whole, including the
     framework of concepts and relations which man erects, for the purpose of bringing
     descriptive order into the world as a whole, including himself as one of the
     elements. In developing the definition in this form I have incorporated the
     understanding, common throughout anthropological literature that the cosmos , the
     totality in which man exists and of which he is a part, is not interpreted in the same
     way by all human groups, but that the many different interpretations lead to a
     variety of cosmologies or theories of the nature of that which is. Thus the universe

                                                    14
                                                                  Chapter 1. - Introduction.

     which is perceived and interpreted by any particular group is a human construction
     which is specific to that group.

                 Various academic disciplines tend to treat the subject of cosmology
     somewhat differently from the dictionary and encyclopaedia definitions.
     Astronomers appear to understand it as a study of the physical bodies of space and
     the relations between them. Historians appear to focus particularly on the aspects of
     religion and mythology; as Bolle ( 1987: 100) says,
                 For historians, including historians of religion, the study of cosmology
           surveys and tries to classify and understand the significance of mythical
           images and religious conceptions concerning the cosmos and the origin and
           structure of the universe

                 Frequently this focussing of cosmology on religion or ritual has also
l
I
I    been a feature of anthropological approaches to the subject. For example, Munn
I

II   (1964) and Goodenough (1986) treat the interpretation of cosmology as a given
     associated with religious concepts but do not attempt to define it. However,
     irrespective of whether a particular study focusses on a single aspect of a society,
     and whether or not it focusses on religion or the physical bodies of space, it
     appears that any of these diverse approaches can be considered as relating to
     particular aspects of the definition as I have outlined it above.

                 Within the anthropological literature the content of material referred to
     by my definition of cosmology is frequently described as world view. Some
     writers, for example Douglas (1973) use the terms interchangeably. Others argue

     for the use of one tenn or the other and Jones (1972) Leichtman (1972) Nelson
     (1972) and Ong (1972) participants in a 1968 conference on world view,
     demonstrated clearly that there was no real agreement as to what the domain of
     meaning of "world view" was, each attempting to establish his own definition of it.

                 Kearney attempted to make an appraisal of the available literature on
     world view and appeared to conclude that there had been no generally accepted
     approach. He then proposed yet another approach (1975:247) wherein he took

                                                    15
                                                            Chapter 1. - Introduction.

            world view to be virtually synonymous with cognitive anthropology in
      the basic sense of cognition indicated in its etymology ...... to get a
      knowledge of.

            This he argued was different from what is normally considered as
cognitive anthropology which he summed up as a combination of ethnoscience and
ethnosemantics. World view, he suggested, differed from this in three significant
ways. First it "makes heavy use of non-verbal behavior." Secondly, traditional
ethnosemantics were limited to a narrow concern with folk taxonomies. His third
distinction which he raised in a discussion of Douglas (1973:254) presented world
view as "concerned with the underlying implicit assumptions about such things as
causality, time or human nature" in contrast to the normal variety of ethnoscience,
which he said, did not.

            My own definition of cosmology incorporates Kearney's "world view"
and both the versions of cognitive anthropology that he distinguishes. However it
separates from cosmology, presuppositions about the nature of existence. These I
consider to be an essential ingredient in the study or analysis of a particular
cosmology, but able to be distinguished from it in such a way that the relations
between the two can be examined. Douglas while considering cosmologies or
world views as types of theories suggests that (1973:173)
             Each theory has its hidden implications. These are its unspoken
      assumptions about the nature of ultimate reality. They are unspoken because
      they are taken for granted. There is no need to make them explicit because
      this is the common basis of experience. Such shared assumptions underlie
      any discourse, even the elaborated speech code which is developed to inspect
      them. They are the foundations on which social reality is constituted as the
      phenomenologists point out

            She does not, as Kearney appears to suggest, explicitly incorporate
assumption as part of a world view theory. Such existential presuppositions or
assumptions, according to this view, function at a more foundational level than the
cosmological theories which appear to be constructed on them. That is to say, that
which is "taken for granted", or presumed about the nature of existence forms a
basis upon which understandings of the cosmos are constructed.

                                               16
                                                             Chapter 1. - Introduction.

             I have, in agreement with Douglas' distinction, separated cosmological
 presuppositions from cosmological theories on the grounds that these appear to
 function at two distinct levels. Douglas (1973:179) asserts of cosmology that
 cosmological theories appear to be consistently subject to change;
               Anyone who finds himself living in a new social condition must ... ...
       ... find that the cosmology he used in his old habitat no longer works. We
       should try to think of cosmology as a set of categories that are in use. It is
       like lenses which bring into focus and make bearable the manifold challenge
       of esperience. It is not a hard carapace which the tortoise has to carry for
       ever, but something very flexible and easily disjointed. Spare parts can be
       fitted and adjustnients made without much trouble.

             I will attempt to show that the data collected at Elcho Island and other

 centres in North East Arnhem Land indicate that most of the changes which have
 been and which continuously are being developed in cosmology appear to be
 occurring at the level of cosmological theory rather than at the level of
 presupposition. Throughout my analysis as I attempt to show the relationships
 between cosmology and the presuppositions upon which it is established, I will
 also attempt to demonstrate that where the cosmology is changing, some at least of
 the foundational level presuppositions appear to maintain their integrity, remaining
 unchanged through the changing circumstances. This of itself would appear to
 indicate supporti"or the suggestion that they function on a different level from the
 normal cosmological theory and in fact enable the maintenance of a stable
 framework upon which theory may be built, altered orreplaced in relation to
 changingcircumstances.

             Since Warner (1937/58) produced his wide ranging ethnography of the
 "Mumgin" as he called the YolIJu, anthropologists, appear to have concentrated on
 particular aspects of YolIJu society. By taking this approach, each researcher has
 been able to produce more in depth analyses of the areas of their choice than could
 otherwise be achieved. At the same time each appears to be aware that while
 gaining more in depth in the field of their specialisation, each work produces only a
_partial understanding of the overall Yol:gu society.

            The task I have set myself is similarly partial in that while I have
attempted to achieve a satisfactory level of analysis in each of the domains of
Yo)-Ou society that I discuss, my overall aim is not to pursue each to its ultimate
analysis but to attempt to examine the relationships between these domains for the
overall coherence which will by that very coherence produce a more sustainable
analysis ofYo)-Ou cosmology. At a simplistic level it could be said that what I have
set out to research is those structures in the mind which the Yo.Iuu use~'hot only in
their explication of the cosmos that is, but in their interaction with and control of it.

            In this I am indebted to other ethnographers for their contributions in
the particular areas covered by the different chapters of this thesis. For the main
part I have referred to these in the chapters where their work is of most relevance to
my own, however I need to make some general reference here to the areas in which
they have made contributions that are relevant to my overall theme. In particular
there are nine writers whose work has made important contributions. These are, in
a semi-historic order, Warner, Thomson and Berndt, who laid foundations for later
anthropologists, and Shapiro, Peterson, Williams, Morphy, Reid and Keen who
have contributed in depth analyses of particular aspects of North East Arnhem
Land life and thought.

            I have had particular recourse to Berndt, Shapiro, Peterson, Morphy
and Keen in the analysis of kinship and family as I have sought to show the
integration between these and cosmology. All nine of the writers have been
important in their contributions to my own understandings of Yolgu religion and to
the conceptualisation of space Only Berndt and Wamer appear to have published
material on the Morning Star complex, this being in the form of recorded .
myths.The ethnography of time herein is entirely based on my own research apart
from contributions made by the three linguists refe.rred to in the chapter. The ways
in which I am indebted to these predecessors will be made explicit as I refer to their;

            SOME YOLtjU CONCEPTS.

            I have taken the approach that to reach an interpretation of the Yol:gu
cosmology which is in any way related to their understanding of it, it is necessary
to listen to their own ideas of the cosmos, how they perceive it, how they structure

it, and what the focus of their thought is in their perceptions of it. While this to a
certain extent has to be done in terms of western categories, which fonn the
foundation of our English language, I have attempted to avoid the imposition of
these wherever possible and to avoid also interpreting either their cosmos or
cosmology as if it was simply a variation of some one or other of the cosmologies
of other peoples described in the anthropological literature.

            It appears that at least in Western cosmologies, and there appear to be a
range of these, the focus of attention is upon such ideas as time, space and material
substance structured in terms of linear continua and quantitative measurement, with
the addition in some cases at least of some perceptions of a spiritual, supernatural
or metaphysical dimension. Most such cosmologies can then be explained through
reference to understandings of these things.

            The Yol:gu cosmos is neither linear nor quantitative so some difficulty
occurs in attempting to describe it as far as finding an adequate place to start, for
the approach to it taken by the Yol:gu, and the thought patterns used by them in
assessing it appear radically different from Western ones.

            By way of introduction to such differences, I have chosen in the
sections which follow to introduce five Yol:gu concepts, an understanding of which
is essential for the discussions which follow. The first of the five is that of the
network of relationships. Associated with its use are the other concepts; focus,
identity, transformation, and the notion of inside and outside, all of which need
some initial explanation, but will be developed further in later chapters.

               Networks of Relationships

               On one occasion, as I was bemoaning the difficulty of explaining the

 Yo]-Ou perception of the cosmos, Djirrimbi!Pi!wuy said to me, "Why don't you use
 the word 'network' ?" With acknowledgement to him, I have chosen to use his term
 as a foundation upon which to build description. In the choice of the word
 "network" as a term to describe the overall cosmos, and in the development and
description of the other associated concepts, it should be pointed out initially that
these are of necessity explanations in English of concepts in Yol:ou language.
While the concepts are transferable between the two, for the most part the terms
chosen in English are not translations of single Yol:ou terms. They, together with
the explanations of their particular useage in the thesis, have been chosen as the
most precise communication of the YoI:ou concepts that I have been able to
 achieve.6

               The choice of the term "network" becomes more significant when
· considered in terms of its derivation from "net". One can think of a net as being
constructed by connecting strings at particular points or by connecting a series of
points together with strings. This is particularly appropriate in the Yol:ou situation
where the connections seen to exist between Yol:ou individuals and groups are
often referred to as strings. This is especially so where these are ceremonially
based relationships, as these are frequently represented by hand made strings of a

variety of different types .

               The idea of string as signifying relationship connections is used
throughout the Yo]-Ou world. One good example of this can be found in the
ritualised way a man may use a string to indicate choice concerning his relationship



 6 There are several aspects of the word "network" which make it an appropriate descriptive term.
 Both a net and a network can be considered to be composed of a series of interconnected points.
 However while a net tends to be based on regularity and is largely constructed in a single plane, a
 networlc has considerable variation in the spacing between connected points and is potentially
 multi-dimensional.

with a woman. As this was explained to me by Djorrpum, an old man now
deceased, a man may hear that a woman, promised to him as a wife, no longer
desires to come to him, or that she has been taken by another man. He will take a
length of a particular kind of string, tie it between two uprights (e.g. two trees) and
sit beneath it. There he waits and decides his response to the situation perhaps
taking several days to do so. His decision is then indicated using the string. If he
cuts it, he is signifying that the relationship between them, represented by the string
connecting the uprights, no longer exists. If he leaves the string where it is, he is
signifying that the connection has been made and will continue. He will then gather
up his spears, and go and get her. In this process the connection made by the string
between two uprights is used as a clear statement of the relationship or severance
of relationship between two individuals.

            "Relationship" as it is used in the following descriptions, carries with it
the implication of a formally structured relationship with established patterns of
behaviour recognised as existing and appropriate between whatever or whoever is
connected by the establishment of that relationship. For the most part these patterns
are perceived in terms of human relationships, each couplet of which is seen to
have an appropriate reciprocal behaviour pattern.

            Identity

            When I asked Rrurrambu, one of the the Yoluu leaders, the question,
''What is it that is of the most value to the Yoluu people?" His very succinct reply,
which included both an answer and a definition of it was, "Knowing identity
-where I fit, what and who I am". This answer with equal accuracy can be rendered
as, "knowing my identity, knowing my relationships, knowing that which gives
meaning to my life."

            Much care has been, and continuously is expended by the Yoluu on the
recognition of, classification of, and naming of identities, and the establishment of


                                               21
                                                                    Chapter 1. - Introduction.

the relationships between identities. This is a different process from the \Vestem
model of identifying things. Particular attention is given by the Yol:ou to the
relationships between groups and between individual humans, between humans
and other species and between humans and land because it is on the basis of these
sets of relationships that identity is established and verified.7

              Where I use the word "identity", I am using it in this wider sense, so
that any named element. or entity within the Yol:ou cosmos can be considered as
having an identity, or more precisely from a YoI:ou perspective, "being an
identity"8. Used in this way, an identity can be any object or any intangible entity
and represented by its name. Each thing is, assumed to "have" an identity and a set
of relationships by which its identity is defined, even when neither identity nor
relationships have been established. That is, all things found to exist are assumed to
have an identity and hence an appropriate set of relationships by which that identity
is defined, even if these details are not known. 9

              As far as the affective aspects of identity are concerned (that is,
whether a person might be described as angry, violent or quiet) I have separated
these from the description of identity in this introduction, considering them as
aspects of a person's nature rather than of their identity in the terms that I have been
discussing. Such a separation is admittedly somewhat pedantic and the two apects
of the individual are drawn together in later discussion.

              In using the term, I am referring to all the entities perceived to exist or
to potentially exist in both the physical and non-physical worlds. Thus, it is
possible to speak of the identity of individuals, but also corporate identities, the



7 These sets of relationships are discussed more fully in Chapter 4.
8This poses some logical difficulties at this introductory level of explanation. However as the
discussion of basic concepts continues thes will be resolved. The main solution lies in the
concepts of inside and outside which are yet to be considered.
9 Often with living things, a relationship will be given between the item being referred to and
some other element of the cosmos. For example, I had an unnamed water plant referred to as
"watetlily's grandmother".

identities of the varied elements of the world and the identities of the supernatural
and mythological beings, as well as the identities of plants, animals and any
relevant substances.

            Focus.

            The concept of focus has two distinct applications. When the notion of .
"identity" is linked to that of "network", an identity can be considered as
functioning as one of the nodes or points to which a set of relationships is attached.
The identity of that particular item is then established through the set of
relationships which connect it to other elements of the cosmos. When this occurs,
the process of determining or establishing an identity can be described as being
determined by evaluating the conjunction or focussing of a set of relationships.
This is the first application I have made of the concept of focus. That is, as the
point where a set ofrelationships come together. Thus identity can in this sense be
said to be determined as the focus of a set of related points.

            If we are to comprehend the wider scope of the Yol:ou perceptions of

the nature of "identity" then an understanding of a second sense of the term "focus"
is critical. This second sense was first made clear to me by Mick Daypurryun, a
senior man of the Liya-gawumirr clan. At the time, we were mapping the places of
significance on the south-western coastline of Elcho Island (see Map 5.5.), an area
for which his clan is a custodian, and I had been trying to establish the location of
the boundaries between two named areas. As we stood on the beach he poked a
hole in the sand with the stick he was carrying. "That", he said, "Is the rock where ·
lJB.Pli (black cockatoo) sat down. We call it '/tjapli nhinan' (black cockatoo sat
down)". (This rock was one we had just marked on the map, a large rock which
stood in the inter-tidal zone on the beac~.) Daypurryun then drew around it an oval
shape which included the "rock" at one end of it. He explained that this was the
area around the rock, which included part of the beach and part of the open
Eucalyptus forest behind the beach. This area represented by the oval around the

                                               23
                                                                   Chapter 1. - Introduction.

rock was also called 'lfapH nhinan'. A line was drawn across the oval to represent
the junction between the beach, and the bush behind it. Land adjacent to the oval
could be considered as being related to it so that there was a still larger area outside
the oval which could also be called by the same name.

             In this brief period of instruction Daypurryun demonstrated that
identity, and the establishment of identity in the naming of sites in Yol:ou thought
are based on focus and relationships, and not on boundary lo. In this case the
identity of areas of land that we were marking on the map depended on the
relationship between the area being identified and the most prominent adjacent
focus of significance. The rock itself was 'l'fafili nhinan'. Any area adjacent to it
was also automatically identified with it and therefore also 'l'faPJi nhinan'. Further
away from the adjacent area, the identification of a site of land depended on its
proximity to (or relationship to) named focal sites. As we continued with the
mapping of the stretch of coastline it became apparent that when we were at some
distance from any significant site, the naming of an area of land was then
potentially open to choice, as the area was in a vague relationship to two sites and
either of these could be considered as a choice for naming the location, depending
on the context at a particular time. The relation between two adjacent focal sites is
illustrated in Figure 1.1; the land between the two focal points being potentially
able to be related to either, depending on the concern at the time of identification.
There was no precise border between the two.

             This idea of focus presents a major contrast between Yol:ou and
Western notions of identity. Western thought strives to establish the identity of a
plot of land by putting a boundary around the area . All that lies within the
boundary is then equally of the same identity. The Yol:ou use of relationship to a
focal point, produces an identification which is relative in intensity according to the



10 A fuller examination of this conttast between focus and boundary is undertaken in a later
chapter on concepts of space (Chapter 5).

     pen:eived proximity to its focus. Where Westerners are most likely to establish a
     boundary, the Yo]Uu are least likely to do so, for at that location, identification is

     least certain and most open to re-evaluation.11




                  Figure 1.1. System of naming areas on basis of significant focal points.
                            (After Mick Daypurryun).

                  This notion of identity and the establishment of identity as being based
                                    •
     on the relationship to (or relativity to) a focus, can be demonstrated in a wide
    · variety of classificatory systems. Identification, and hence the defining of identity,
     is carried out in terms of relationship to a series of foci which are presumed to be
     permanently identified and unchanging in nature. Thus the identifying of a colour is
     relative to its proximity, in terms of three categories of colour saturation, to one of
     the set of colour foci in a way analogous to the way in which the identifying and
     naming of any area of land is relative to its proximity to named points or features.
     These applications of focus can be generalised to say that the determination of the
     identity of anything is dependant upon the perceived connection (or relationship)

     between that item and existing, recognised focal points. In line with this, it is
     possible to project the implication that the strength or clarity of identity is relative to
~    the strength of connection to (or closeness to or relationship with) a particular

     focus, an aspect that will be seen to be very significant in later discussion of human



     11 But see further discussion of the establishment of boundaries in Chapter S.

identity. The corollary of this is that if a thing (or a person) has no connection with
anything of significance, then it (or they) lack identity and are therefore irrelevant.12

             Because of the way in which the identity of anything is defined in
terms of its relationship to other elements of the cosmos, it is extremely difficult if
not impossible to take any single element of the Yol:gu cosmos and examine it in
isolation. No part of the cosmos exists in isolation but all are related in many
directions to other parts. Each specific identified element becomes the focus of a set
of relationships which links other elements as part of the overall network; each of
these in turn links to other elements and this pattern of interrelated elements
continues without boundaries or limits. One result of this is that the whole cosmos
becomes a single unbounded network of of inter-related elements. Simply by
definition it is impossible to describe it comprehensively (i.e. one cannot
encompass the parameter of an unbounded entity). This then brings us to a
preliminary working definition of the YolIJu cosmos wherein it can be defined as
an unbounded network of identities -in relationship to each other. Yol:gu cosmology
becomes then an application of this perception.

             Change and Transformation

             It is important to recognise at this point a distinction between an
identity and an individual. The individual is seen as having an identity which may
                                                                                                 I
                                                                                                 I

be focussed differently in different contexts, and it is that identity which is seen as

being unchanging. Two things are observed as changing, the external appearances

of individuals (or discrete elements of the cosmos) and the relationships between
them.13




12 Thus, for example, any visiting white people are only of relevance to the community if they
have connections with people of already established relationships.
13 In the sense of the increasing complexity of relationships.
                                                                  Chapter 1. - Introduction.

             While the individual is observed to change, this change is considered in
tenns of transformation of the outward expression of an unchanging identity. Such
change as does occur is then able to be considered as an expression of a part of the
identity that has until that point, been dormant. Some, though not all identities are
seen as going through an identified series of transformations of outer form, while
their inner nature is seen as unchanging. The stages of transformation are
considered in relation to one another as different expressions of single identities.
There are two different types of transformation with classified stages. The first type
appears to be considered as a series of transformations in a single direction, each
successive stage being a more complete expression of identity than the preceding
one.14 The second type of transformation involves movement in and out of
expression in a known repeating pattern but also in a single direction.15 In both
types there is a consistent pattern in the stages of transformation and there is a wide
range of identities which are seen as going through such series of recognised
stages.

             With transformations occurring in the relationships between these
unchanging identities, it is in these transformations and their manipulation that the
foundation of YohJu politics lies. The notion of the establishment of relations to
form connections to one's own advantage is constantly being employed in the
complex domain of YohJu politics. The notions of power and of identity are closely
linked to each other, and to the notions of closeness of relationship to, and
authority concerning focal points of ceremonial significance (whatever forms these
points may take). The establishment of position, and hence of identity in regard to
these nodes is facilitated by the relativity of relationship and the potential for the
application of pressure within the wholly flexible unbounded system. In this way
some aspects of transformation at least are considered as being able to be

3!.

controlled. Much political manoevering is then based on the manipulation of the
degree of proximity to the nodes, through assertion and counter-assertion.

              Inside and Outside.

              There appear to be two aspects to every identity, an "outside"
(wamqJul) aspect ~d an "inside" (djinawa) aspect. However.the use of these two
terms is spread over a wide field of meaning. One aspect' of this spread may be
able to be interpreted as the contrast between the physical body and the emotions,
although in the following extract from his Sunday morning sermon Dauat4)a, an
experienced health worker, was referring to more than the emotions,
              I can help .... if he is hurt with a spear or a gun shot. That's the outside
       that's hurt, but I can't help if hurt on the inside. Only Jesus can see the inside
       and help him on the inside

              Some things are thought of as "outside" though they have an inside
aspect, others appear to be almost exclusively "inside" while potentially at least
having "outside" aspects. Those things that are "outside" are in the open where
they may be hiµidled, or at least seen by all, including women and children.
"Inside" at one polarity of its usage refers to those things of a secret I sacred
nature16 which in most cases can only be seen by men or touched by men. When
used this way the word is interchangeable with magayin (secret/sacred things) as
shown in a brief quote from Bapawun who made the observation that
             Banumbirr is "outsidepuy" (belonging to the outside) yaka magayin
       (not sacred) miyalk ga djamarrkuli (women and children) watch ..

              This aspect was emphasised by Rrurrambu, who in defining it said,
             Djinawa is also called gandja. It is very secret things not to be known.
       It concerns the stuff that is passed on through some of the family line. Biipa
       dhugunupan (the father will give) only to those who he sees will treat it with
       respect.




16 It is this sense which is largely the focus of Morphy's discussion of the two tenns (1991:75-
99) though he does intimate a wider useage without expanding on it in detail.
                                                              Chapter 1. - Introduction.

             There is no clear boundary between inside and outside existence and
there is passage between the two in either direction by the previously discussed
process of transformation. There is also overlap between them, so as a result
anything in the outside can be thought of as having inside attributes. For example, a
single entity may have some meanings that are inside and some that are outside.
Similarly it would appear that potentially at least, anything of the inside can h&'\'C
outside transformations which can be touched and experienced such as the animal
form of some "totems". In some ways this contrast appears to be similar to that

between the notions of "sacred" and "profane", however as I will show in later
chapters, there are aspects of the contrasts that would be lost if restricted to this
dichotomy.

             There are degrees of insideness, and more significant things may be
referred to in English as being "deeper" inside, "more deeper" or "more inside",
and there are terms used in the categorisation of such levels of insideness which
will be discussed in later sections of the thesis. Djangirrawuy, in an attempt to
describe this notion, drew a visual analogue of it in terms of the structure of a tree.

This, represented by Figure 1.2, was based on the degrees of insideness of ritual
invocations (bundurr) The significance of the analogue and of the terms used will
become more apparent in later discussion.

              In the more general sense "inside" has a much wider potential in terms
of its use in regard to cosmological assumptions. As all that has an identity, is
perceived to have a continuing existence, "inside", is where all things which have
been previously experienced as "outside" have their continuing existence~
Similarly, by implication, all new things which come to be experienced, must have
existed previously, so by virtue of their being experienced, must have been either
"inside" or somewhere else "outside" prior to their being experienced.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LAND AND SACREDNESS IN
IDENTITY.

              A further result of the cosmos being "an unbounded network of
unchanging identities in flexible relationships", is that the whole society, so to
speak, is afloat on a sea of relativity, where every classification or evaluation, is
relative to every other one and to every other context of evaluation. The society
according to this is potentially adrift without any secure base, so insecurity ought to
be the order of the day. However in the Yoluu cosmos, the mag~yin, (sacred
elements of the religion), and in particular the rBf}ga (sacredceremonialobjects)
function as anchors to hold the whole fluid cosmological network stable, by fixing
it to the network of sacred sites which are spread across the land. This is one major
reason for these sites and objects having so much importance to Aboriginal
society.17

              A further significance of the rat]ga (ritual items) is that they are
tangible representations of the inside aspects of identity. As one man said to me it



17 And for the Yol~u also, focus on location of events rather than their time of occurrence (See
Chapter6).
                                                              Chapter 1. - Introduction.

is not the wooden objects that are of the greatest significance but the invisible
identity that they represent, or, as he put it, "You look at the sacred object, lt
represents the nqiga, but you can't see it, only the object". Another basis of the
power of the raaga in relation to identity is that they represent an identity which in
its various transformations cross-cuts the different dimensions of existence. For
example, assuming that part of your identity is snake, it can be represented in the
form of a snake ravga, or in a different transformation, it can appear as a living
snake to your parents before birth, indicating your identity, (and incidently your
mother's pregnancy with you)IS. There is tangible physical evidence of the
ancestral snake in the physical stuff left behind by it at your sacred site, which may
take the form of particular rocks or a watercourse, a tree, or even the hole or
waterhole that the ancestor went into in its/his transformation from the physical
snake fonn of its manifestation. The occurrence which happened in "other" space
and "other" time is simultaneously present through the different physical
manifestations in current time as well as within the individual. At times of
ceremonial, when the sacred objects are refurbished, for at least some Yoh.Ju, the
ancestral being becomes actually present (Berndt 1948 :311) and that presence may
be recognised in a spiritual experience. Hence through the apprehension of this
multiple manifestation of the entity and its affiliation with land, and therefore of
your own identity across dimensions, personal stability is achieved and through
this security is facilitated.

             APPROACH TO DESCRIPTION.

             Because each element of the Yoluu cosmos is identified by its position
in relation to other elements, the identity of each aspect of the cosmos is then
structured similarly (analogously) to every other part, a description of the cosmos
can begin at any point and move at random in any direction. I have chosen to begin

with considerations of the Yoluu notions of identity in terms of the non-physical or
supernatural aspects of the cosmos. With this being established as a foundation,
each of the succeeding chapters will then concentrate around a single focus and
follow the connections outward from it to demonstrate its relationship to the
structure of the overall cosmos.The two chapters which follow this are concerned
with the place of the Yoluu within their cosmos. One of these considers the
transformations through which a person passes during a lifespan, the other
concentrates on the human person, as an individual in a network of human

              Two chapters discuss aspects which appear to be traditional in at least
some descriptions of cosmologies, that is, those associated with space and with
time. Description of the concepts of space and of the land, show that the land forms
a relatively stable basis to which man relates and to which the other aspects of the
cosmos can be related. Yoliju time concepts are considered in detail in an attempt to
solve the problems of what has been an area of anthropological enquiry fraught
with misconceptions and argument. I discuss the Yoluu notions of duration and the
place within these concepts of the idea of The Dreaming (Stanner) in relation to
Yo~u existential presuppositions.

              Chapter 7 is concerned with Bagumbirr, which is the Yoluu name for
the Morning Star. Linked to this is a composite of myth and ritual, meanings and

relationships, which spreads across the entire Yoiuu territory. I refer to this
composite with its various extensions and relationships as the BanumbirrComplex.
There are a number of reasons for its choice for description. Firstly, while the
complex is a small section of the cosmos, yet it forms an example of the cosmos in
miniature. Therefore, what can be drawn from it is exemplary of the overall
cosmos. Next, and of major significance in the choice is the fact that the 1itual

objects have been explicitly described to me as being non-sacred20. This means that

the exposition is less fraught with the difficulties involved with the open discussion

of secret-sacred materials. Finally there is the availability of a wide range of data,

unpublished but recorded in archives, museums and galleries around the country.


             The conclusion of the thesis incorporates an analysis of the elements of

the Banumbirr complex, a summary of cosmological presuppositions which form

the foundations of the cosmology, and a drawing together of the threads developed

through the body of the thesis.


             In the process of working through the different subject areas, I will

also demonstrate that there are at least two levels on which the cosmos can be

examined; a superficial one which is constantly open to change, and an inner one

(using the word "inner" here in a Yol!Ju sense) which is capable of incorporating

change while remaining constant.


             It is my intention by the end of this thesis to have demonstrated that the

Yoluu Cosmos is a viable and living structure, which while as the Yoluu say of it

that it "is unchanging" yet it is capable within that "unchangingness", of constant

adaptation to changing circumstances and experiences while at the same time

providing stability and a secure perception of identity through that change.

            THE ETERNAL COSMOS.
                   C'
            INTRODUCTION.

            In the same way that any "identity" can be thought of as having an
"inside" and an "outside" aspect, the Yoluu cosmos can be considered as a single
reality with two sides, one side of which is subject to transformation, while the other
remains unchanging. It is too simplistic to separate these as physical and spiritual
worlds and I have chosen to follow the Yoluu practice and describe one as the outside
or the outside of reality and the other as the inside or the inside of reality. The eternal
cosmos, the focus of this chapter, is an inner reality which is potentially both the
source and the destiny of everything in the outer reality of human experience. It is a
kind of parallel existence with a different quality in which everything is equivalent to,
analogous to, or a transformation of the outer reality. Put the other way around it           l
would appear to be truer of Yoluu ways of referring to the "inside" to treat it as the        I
original template of which everything "outside" is equivalent to, analogous to, or a
transformation of it.                                                                         I
                                                                                              I

experienced tobacco, so knows tobacco. Similarly knowledge of the "inside" is
                                                                                              : .-
experiential. Existence of the eternal cosmos is unquestioned as it is demonstrated
through historic contact at known places, and this contact is demonstrated by the
traces or transformations left behind in the landscape by beings of various kinds who
have come from the inside reality. The actions of these beings, men and ancestors at
known places are recorded in terms of narratives, and in the song-poetry, dance, and
two and three dimensional representations which were left behind by them, and men
experience going "inside" when they are involved in "inside" ceremonies.

            Man's knowledge of the inner side of reality is not total because no-one
knows all, and there is always more to be known. With the presupposition of

changelessness in the inner reality then, as Bos suggests (1988. 392-393), anything
new which becomes part of experience, and thus "known", has to be part of what
always was. It appears possible that in the past, all new experiences could have been
attributed to some new contact with the inside. However, beginning with visits from
Indonesian trepangers, then later Japanese pearlers and European Australians, contacts
with other previously unknown Aboriginal groups, and now international travel, there
has also developed an awareness that the "outside" also contains far more than anyone
has previously known. As I will demonstrate in later sections of this and later
chapters, there is room for these new realities to be incorporated into the inside reality.

             The "inside" explained by means of analogues is taken for granted by all
                                                                                              ; _.

the Yoliju with whom I have had discussions over the years, though there is wide
variation in the perceived nature and contents of that domain. In this chapter, I attempt
to discuss some of the range of ideas expressed concerning this inside of reality, its

characteristics, and the entities which are considered to exist there. The discussion
includes consideration of what is presented by the Yoliju as if it relates to their
knowledge of reality prior to outside contact and observations of some of the changes
that have been incorporated since contact with non-Yoliju people.

      MANIFESTATIONS OF THE INSIDE OF REALITY.

             A number of different terms are used to refer to discrete traditionallyl
recognised entities that can be experienced, but do not normally have a tangible form.
Among these are: mokuy, birrimbirr, wavarr, and djamarrkuJi. All of these refer to
different beings, although there are occasions when the discriminations made between
them blur and the characteristics of the entities overlap. Across the literature these
have been variously described in English by a wide lexicon of terms such as spirits,
ghosts, trickster spirits, souls, ancestral beings, ancestral spirits, spirit(ual) beings,
supernatural powers and totems, and this is not an exhaustive list of English



1 see footnote 2 in Chapter 1.

                                                        Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

translations. In addition to these terms there are other manifestations of the inside of
reality which are collectively called magayin (sacred elements) some of these being

referred to by the Yoq,u in English as "totems". In addition to these, and of obviously
more recent introduction, the Christian Trinity has been added to perceptions of the
revealed inner side of reality, and with this the Holy Spirit has received considerable
attention.

             My purpose in the section which follows is to give an outline of the
Yoivu concepts of these entities and an introduction to themes which will be examined
more fully in later sections of the chapter. Rather than try and describe the different
entities one at a time by defining the terms that are used for them in either the Yol:gu or
English languages, I will attempt to discuss them in conceptual domains. Thus I

consider separately the notions of "totems", ancestral figures, mokuy, djamarrkul.i,
traces and transformations in the landscape, and the Holy Spirit, all of which in one
way or another appear to be treated as manifestations of the unchanging inside of
reality. Later in the chapter I will examine in more detail some of the attitudes towards,
experiences of and conceptualisations of the latest experiences of the inside of reality
which have occurred during and since the 1979 Arnhem Land Revival and its
perceived relation to the earlier "Adjustment Movement in Arnhem Land" (Berndt
1962).·

             While the major wavarr(ancestral figures) are given greater importance, I
will discuss the "children", mokuy, birrimbirrand "totems first. I begin with them
because I want to explore what I consider to be a new approach to the understanding
of these entities and it is easier in terms of a sequential discussion to begin with them
and proceed to a discussion of the wavarr beings after that.

             "Children".

            In Chapter 3, I discuss the notion of the pre-birth existence of the
                            •
individual and the way in which this yothu (child-singular) is recognised as coming to
                                                                 Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

its parents ostensibly to announce its coming and the nature of its identity. These

djamarrkuJ.i (children-multiple) as I will show are believed to exist before birth, and
there appears to be some degree of concensus that prior to taking on a particular

"totemic" form to make the announcement of their presence, they exist in an undefined

form in the water. This frequently means that they are spoken of as found in the water

at the clan's yirralka (homeland centre).


              DjamarrkuJ.i is also the term used for the familiar spirits that sit on the
shoulders of the mediums and whose functions are to communicate information to

them and carry out tasks given by them2. Thus there is a notion of an indefinite sort of

spirit being which in some ways is considered to be a pre-formed or pre-emerged

human being and which can communicate with human beings .


              Mokuy.

              There are two quite distinct uses of the term 11 mokuy". The first of these

refers to a dead human, a corpse, or sometimes the continuing aspects of the recently

deceased. In the story of YawulIJura (see Chapter 7 and Appendix), a living man who

visited an island of the dead, B urralku. The mokuys already there ask if he is a newly

dead person, using the word mokuy to do so. The narrator uses the same word to

refer to those dead who are already on the island, thus applying the term to those who

have been dead for a longer time. The second use of the term refers to a group of what

can be called spirit beings. In this case, "mokuy is used to refer to a group of
                                                          11




similarly perceived entities. There are some anonymous spirits, or spirits which may

not have been specifically identified, but there are others which are identified by

personal names, by association with particular clans or groups of clans, and particular

behaviour patterns. The members of the "known 11 group are celebrated in dance, song,

painting and myth, being generally part of a clan's non-sacred ceremonial stock.

 However some also appear to be identified with things of high significance to a clan
 and some to be associated with the ancestral beings.


              In the normal way of Yoluu classificatory terms, number is not included

 in the noun and when the word "mokuy'' is used, it refers to a class of beings,

 sometimes with reference to a single being and at other times to a group3. An
 indication of the ownership of and characteristics attributed to some mokuy of the
 second type can be gained from Table 2.1.

              When one starts discussing mokuy with the Yoiuu it becomes apparent
 that there is no totally unaniI~ous understanding of their nature, their origins or their
 degree of malevolence, although where they have become celebrated in song and
 dance there is a degree of common interpretation. Many of them have multiple names
 just the same as the Yoluu. For example I was told that the Liya-galawumirri4 mokuy
 has his "real" name Warralawarrala, but when he is sung about he has the special song
 name ofYii:uanydja, and that the Wangurri mokuywhose "big name" is Djinpan, has
. the song names, Guwunun and Mitjpunun when he is male and when female has the·
 names, Liya-wanhurr, Gurrinybal and Rraparrapa.

              Warner (1958: 545 - 561) records a series of stories about a mokuy
 named Wurray (his Ure), alias Bamapama, that he describes as;·
              "the trickster hero of the Mumgin. He was a man who lived in the
       mythological period and committed a great number of asocial acts, most of them
       incestuous. He is depicted as ever filled with sexual desire and always anxious
       to satisfy it by attacking the wives of other men, particularly those women who
       belong to his own moiety."

              Each of these named beings has its own characteristics. Some can be
 aligned with the concept of a trickster as Warner suggests. Others are described as
 more benign hunters of yams, gatherers of honey, or hunters of kangaroos or
 wallabies. Those that are named appear inevitably to hunt particular species which are

                                .
 3 We will see this with the use of the proper name, Mukarr in Chapter 3 in the song of the turtle
 ~ rope. There the proper name can refer to either a single being or to a group of them.
 4 Name of the clan or group "owning" the mokuy.

of significance to the clans with which they are associated. One young man in
describing molcuys and referring to one English concept that has been applied to
them, said, ''They aren't demons, demons are different, they buma (hit, beat, harm,kill)

             An older man, talking about the characteristics of mokuys said that they

don't talk language like people, and they don't wash. They were able to let people

know of their presence by hitting trees with an axe or by pushing trees with their

hands so that the trees fell down5. As to their origin he suggested what appears to be

a commonly held view that they were humans at first who had been speared, or got

sick and died and become mokuy; if they were bofl.iny (calm, quiet, peaceful, non-

savage) type of people they would have become binimbirr(see later discussion), but

if they were mafl.akarritj (dangerous, harmful) then that would explain why they had

become mokuy.


             In summary then, "mokuy" can refer to the recently deceased, the long

dead, or to any of a series of named beings or unidentified spirits who may or may not

be considered to have been human once, the specific meaning being relevant to

context. They can, in a number of contexts, be thought of as being somewhat

equivalent to the common English use of the word "ghost".


             Birrimbirr.

             Birrimbirris the term commonly used to translate the English word

"spirit". As a result the Holy Spirit of Christianity becomes Binimbirr Dhuyu (lit.

spirit holy or sacred) and Satan is often called YiitjkurruBirrimbirr(bad or evil spirit)

although this later term is also used to described an evil spirit of any kind. Morphy

(1984:40,41) refers to birrimbirras one of "two souls or perhaps dimensions of soul"

the other of which is mokuy. He draws the distinction between them saying that,

            After a person has died the mokuy goes to a part of the clan's territory
      where mokuy spirits live, and exists there as a ghost. ... ...
            The Birrimbirr soul is a complex concept which refers to that aspect of a
      person's spiritual existence that comes from the ancestral beings ...... On death,
      the birrimbirr soul is believed to return to the clan land of the dead person in
      order to become reincorporated within the reservoir of Ancestral power
      associated with that place.




5 He added that there were three causes for trees falling; man, wind and mokuy.

                                                   40

             Although I would not analyse these perceptions as leading to a concept of

a "reservoir of Ancestral power" all of Morphy's observations agree with statements

that YoJ.uu have made to me. Williams ( 1986:32) also refers to individuals' spirits

being characterised by two aspects, though suggests that of these, one is good and the

other bad. My own observations would indicate that the situation is more complex and

that any dichotomy is less precise than these suggestions would indicate. One

statement made consistently by the Yoluu is that the birrimbirr goes to Burralku (the

place of the dead) after a man dies, but as shown in the preceding section, it is also

said that when a man dies that mokuy (dead one) goes to Burralku. There is no actual

conflict in these ideas being used in this way. Nor, as I will show in the next chapter,

is there conflict with the statements made in the quote from Morphy where these two

are said to go to the clan territory.


             The distinctions made between the two are very similar to, though not the

same as, the distinctions made between "person" or "personality" and "the deceased"

in English. Birrimbirrin its general use refers to something more associated with the

personality and or spirit of a person in contrast to their structural physical or spiritual

form and is perhaps closest to a non-physical transformation of a person's identity.


             Totems.

             A wide range of mythological narratives has been recorded that are

concerned with what is often referred to as "totems". So familiar has this word

become to the Yoliju that they accept and frequently use it as the English translation of

their word magayin. It is not my intent to become embroiled in the discussion of

whether the things so named are"totems", as the definitions of such words are subject

to contextual use and to definition. Yoluu magayin definitely do not equate to the

common English usage of "totem"which seems to be close to the idea of a team

identity symbol. My purpose is not to examine this contrast between Yoluu and non-

y oJ.uu use of the word, buttather to consider the understandings YolIJu have of the

things they are talking about, whichever word they use.


                                                41
                                                             Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

             In conversation they may use either word as a classificatory term to speak

of a set of items which are of ceremonial significance to them, but it is more usual for
them to enumerate their items separately by name. At every site there have been such
items deposited by one or another Ancestral Being6. Thus it can be said of the site
named Gangan, that the being Barama put there minhala the tortoise, wurran the
diving bird, birrkufl.a the bee's hive, marki the freshwater crayfish, and mundukul the
black headed python. It seems to be more normal to enumerate them this way than to
say that Barama put the masJayin there, although both statements are correct.

             It is this mode of naming the masJayin with the names of natural species
that apparently led to the idea that each magayin, or totem represents a natural species,
and that men therefore have established relationships of some kind with natural
species. (For example see Elkin 1938nO: 166 and Meggitt 1962n4:59). The names of
the natural species are however "outside" names and as Williams (1986:40) says,
            Names are also ranked: some are "big", "inside", sacred, and knowledge
      of them is stringently regulated; others are "little", "outside", names and
      everybody knows them.

             Saying that Barama created or made them or put them at that particular
site, and the fact that these natural species are usually common at the site, has led to
the idea that these ancestral figures such as Barama or Dja.JJ'kawu created the natural
species. For example, Morphy (1984:7) refers to "Ancestral beings who created ... ".
This is not entirely erroneous in the sense that there were items made and deposited at
each site. However the items identified as being deposited were not the natural species

but a construction made usually from such materials as wood or paperbark decorated
with feathers, strings and paint. These constructions, named with the names of the
natural species are representations of spirits or spirit beings deposited at the sites. It is
primarily with these representations and the spiritual entities that they stand for that the
Yoluu identify, and only secondarily with the natural species which are seen in some
way as "outside" transformations of them.


6 I use Morphy's tenn here for the Yoluu word wavarr which is discussed in the next section


                                                   42
                                                             Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

             Thus at each site there was given to the local clan a set of magayin (sacred

items, which includes also the associated songs, designs, dances and rituals

representative of the "identities" of the inside reality at that site). This set represents

the identity of the site, and simultaneously part of the identity of the owning clan,

hence also a large part of the identity of the individual members of the clan who own

or care for the site.


              W411arr, The Ancestral Beings.

             Most of what I have said about the "totems" can equally be said about the

"ancestral beings". The differences between them seem to lie in the fact that firstly the

major beings were distributors of others, while what I have described as "totems" are

for the most part individual elements that are spoken of as either being deposited by

ancestral beings or as moving by themselves or in small groups of two or three,

apparently without distributing anything else. Secondly the major beings are explicitly

anthropomorphic, and thirdly they link large groups of clans of one moiety.


             Amongst the coastal clans the major Dhuwa moiety ancestors are the

Djaij'kawu and the Wawilak (or Wagilak) Sisters, each of which is celebrated in a

totally distinct myth/ritual complex. The major Yirritja ancestors, all of whom are

celebrated in the one myth, are Barama, Lanytjun, Galparrimun and Banatja7. In each

of the myths thes<tl?eings appear to have the characteristics of humans combined with

those of supernatural beings, and it appears to be this combination of attributes which

has been responsible for the wide diversity in attempts to classify them in English.


             Each of these three myths purports to be a historical record of the journey

of a set of ancestral figures across the coastal sections of North East Arnhem Land

country. These travels form the basis for the current structure and contents of the

religious activities of the Yoluu people, the figures being commonly referred to as


1 In referring to there being three sets of major wagarr, my focus is on statements made by members
of Yo~u groups represented at Elcho Island and Yirrkala, and may not reflect the number relevant to
other parts of Arnhem Land.

waoazr. No two Yoliju people recount these myths in the same way, though there are
common themes which run through all versions. What follows therefore is my own

brief summary of each of them based on discussions with the older men from Elcho

and Yirrkala and with reference to the major works in the literature. [These include

especially the works of Berndt R (1951and1952), Warner (1937/58) and Groger-

Wurm (1973)].


              The Djatj'kawu myth.


              The Djau'kawu according to most versions came from an island

somewhere to the East of Arnhem Land which is usually called Burralku. They travel

by canoe, paddling all the way, and bring with them in the canoe a quantity of ranga

(sacred objects) carried in van.marra (large conical mats), together with their bathi

(sacred dilly bags) and digging sticks for which there is a wide range of names. The

term Djau'kawu is a collective term for a group of individuals which among the clans

east of Elcho Island is generally described as a brother and two sisters. Among these

clans Djau'kawu is also the personal name of the brother. Further west the clans speak

only of the two sisters.


              The men from Elcho and to the east seem to be in some agreement that the

Djau'kawu came first to RirratjiIJu country, landing at YalaIJbara near Port Bradshaw,

then from there travelled across the country from the site belonging to one Dhuwa

clan to the next, avoiding for the most part contact with anything including country

which belongs to the Yirritja Moiety8. As they travel, either by foot or canoe, they

carry with them the van.marra full of ragga, their dilly bags and digging sticks.(See

Figure 2.1.). At each place to which they come in their travels there is a fairly standard

pattern of activities that, in the non-restricted versions of the stories appear to include

the establishment of waterholes by the plunging of their digging sticks into the

                               ..
8 The order in which the clans and their different locations are visited varies from informant to
informant. Apart from the general details, each man's narration is one that emphasises his own clan's
priorities.


                                                    45

ground, the identification or depositing of particular species as sacred objects for that
location, the singing of songs relevant to that location and often a depositing of
children. At some locations when the digging sticks are plunged into the ground these
are spoken of also as growing into trees.

             At each location something of significance occurs which makes the
activities at that site unique and hence serves to identify the site itself as a unique
location. For example, following Groger-Wurm's (1973: 23, 24) descriptions, in
Marrakulu country at Trial Bay they made the goanna, djalka [djarrka] a dreaming for
the Marrakulu, in Gfilpu country they made a sacred waterhole and placed rarJga
(sacred objects) in it. In Djapu country between Caledon and Trial Bays, they made
waterholes, and at that place they also saw goannas, brolgas and pelicans and made
them dreamings
     ti           ti.




            During their travels there comes a time when the sisters hang up their
baskets on a tree and then go to collect shellfish. While they are absent the baskets are
stolen by men who in so doing establish the ongoing justification for men's
dominance in ritual and the women's roles as gatherers of food and bearers of
children. I have been shown the site where this theft occurred on two separate
occasions at places a hundred kilometres apart. Keen (197 8) and others record still
other sites where the event occurred. In every case the site shown is adamantly
claimed to be theplace where the sacred items were stolen.

            The Wiwilak Myth.

            In this myth two sisters from the Wawilak clan from south central
Arnhem Land become pregnant to men of their own clan, leave their country and
travel north. As they travel they carry out the normal activities offood gathering
common to Yol:gu women and each evening camp for the night, cook their food and
then continue their journey..to the north, with one of them giving birth to a child as

they travel. Eventually they camp at a waterhole named Mirarrmina (and various other

names), which, unknown to them is the home of a great python. Inadvertently one of

them pollutes the water with blood9 and this disturbs the python. In some versions

also the second sister gives birth at Miramnina.


              They start to cook the vegetables and animals they have gathered that day

but these run out of the fire and into the waterhole. At this point they realise that they

are witnessing something unusual. A cloud caused by the python appears over them

and rain begins to fall on them only. The sisters construct a bark hut for shelter, then

they dance to stop the rain without success. The python comes towards them and they

try to hide in the hut. He 10 swallows all the humans and retreats to the water where he

feels sick (because the two sisters are Dhuwa moiety the same as he is) and vomits

them up. Ants bite them and they come alive again. The snake reswallows them

gaining another severe stomach ache. He stands up to the sky and crashes to the

ground, leaving a triangular mark on the ground 11. After being forced to confess his

crime to other serpents, he flies away and in some versions of the story creates a

variety of places, species, waterholes and eventually men. Kupka (1965: 112) records

that the sisters later appeared to men in dreams teaching them the story and the

ceremonial details associated with the events.


              Barama, Lany'tjun, Oalparrimun.

              I first recorded the myth that links these names in 1967 in association with

a series of paintings by men of the DhalwaIJu Gumana clan. In outline their version of

the story tells that Barama came ,out of the sea and arrived at Gangan in DhalwaIJu
country where he taught sacred designs for the Yirritja clans to two men, Lany'tjun

who travelled to the north, and Galparrimun who travelled to the south. These men

distributed sacred items to all the Yirritja clans, however one group became jealous of

reccxds it as her menstrual blood.

Lany'tjun because he had too many sacred things, and they killed him12. He fell on an

 ant's nest and their bites stung him back to life whereupon he returned to his original

country and became a large paperbark tree beside the waterhole there.


              Linked to this myth is a wide range of stories which focus on the

distribution to individual sites and clans, of different versions of the diamond patterns

used by the Yirritja clans in their paintings, with diamonds being interpreted as fire,

water or honey by different clans according to the associations of the events in their

country.


              Those then are very basic summaries of the three major myths. Even at

this level it is reasonably straightforward to isolate features that identify each set of

ancestors as discrete.


              Traces.

             Wherever the Ancestral beings travelled, they left traces of their passing in

· the landscape, and these traces are seen to be the transformation of some part of or

some body product of the ancestor, or the results of its action at a place. For example,

it seems that almost inevitably the red, yellow, white and black pigment deposits

across Arnhem Land are transformations of some part of an ancestral being. These

include such things as turtle fat or the fat of other animals, dugong faeces, honey and

pollen (see Rudder 1983:103).


              Transformations may be entire geographic features or a single rock on a

long beach, a tree, an impression in the surface of a rock or a combination of any or all

of these13. An example of this is the shark site at the southern end of the Martjanba

Island where the prominent headland is the shark's head (See Map 2.1 and Figure 2.2)




11.other versions have it that they killed him because he was singing sacred songs out in the open as
he travelled along.
13 Muon's (1970: 142) suggestion that there are three types of transformation; metmorphosis,
imprinting and externalisation is supported by the Arnhem Land material described here.

             A billabong and stream flowing from it to the sea are the shark's stomach

and alimentary canal and the mouth of the stream is the shark's mouth. On the beach a

small rock is the shark's brain (Plate 2.2.) and a double depression in the rock surface

on a cliff top adjacent to the beach is a transform of the shark's liver. (Plate 2.1.).


             At sites where the major mythological figures are said to have "gone

inside" there is likely to be a whole series of such traces as mentioned above or as

discussed in Chapter 5 concerning the southern end of Elcho Island 14. At the location

where the Djru;J'kawu went inside, there is one rock in particular that is considered to

be a transformation of one of the Djru;J'kawu women. (See Plates 5.1. to 5.3).


             There is not a high degree of discrimination used in naming the various

spiritual entities responsible for the traces in the landscape. For example in listing and

describing a number of sites one of the elderly men said of the place named Bun'tayal

thata
             Wa()arr,             mokuy,           dhulyurruna     marthavay,    balanda,
             ancestral being      dead one         built           a boat        white man

             (then         he dragged it           through the creek/watercourse.


             This roughly approximates in English to saying that there was an ancestral

being who was or is a deceased person, who was a white man, made a boat and

dragged it through the creek at that place. This sentence makes perfect sense although

the ideas appear complex. I include it here simply to indicate how the meanings of the
terms overlap or at least appear to do so. They are certainly not used in a clear cut and

consistent way all the time. On other occasions Yoluu have attempted to clearly

distinguish between Wa()arr and mokuy and it would not be normal to describe a

balanda (white man) as a Wa()arr (ancestral being). I take up the discussion of these

"spiritual entities" in later discussion of the afterlife in Chapter 3.




14 Morphy, Keen, Berndt and others record such series of traces.

               The Holy Spirit.

               In 1979, there began on Elcho Island what has since become known as the

Arnhem Land Revival, an indigenous Christian movement that began at Galiwinku
early in 1979. Almost every Yol:ou adult was involved to some extent at least initially.
While the obvious involvement of individuals has shrunk in terms of numbers, the
majority of the community now consider themselves to be Christians. In 1981 I had
the opportunity to discuss with Djorrpum, one of the senior ceremonial leaders his
own early experience of it. His first sentence was a very concise summary of a more
general Yoliju response,
           We heard that the Holy Spirit was born at the top of the hill [the church],
      so we went up to meet him.

               That is to say that the knowledge of the Holy Spirit came by experience.
The missionaries had brought many stories, and there had over the years been a
number of Yol:ou individuals who had had experiences of one kind or another with
the Christians' God, but until 1979 this had remained a matter for individuals. Now
almost the whole community was swept up into a corporate experience of "coming
under a conviction of the presence of God" in the form that they recognised as the
Holy Spirit.

               As I have considered this very much Yoliju movement, it appears to
exactly match Yol:ou understandings of life and of the relationship between the
"inside" and the "outside". The fact that the Holy Spirit has come "outside" has
produced an ongoing awareness of a new freedom to meet with God, and to come into
contact with the "inside" reality in a controlled but less restricted way. The annual
"Revival Thanksgiving Weekend" has developed as an important ceremonial event on
the annual calendar, and I discuss this later in the chapter in relation to "The Two
Revivals"

            TAPPING POWER.

            There is widespread if not universal belief that in addition to the above
mentioned manifestations of the inner side of reality, there is available some kind of
undefined power which can be used in various ways for both good and evil purposes.
There are various terms used to refer to such activities and to the persons who carry
them out. Though there is a fairly wide variation in the way the terms are used, there
does appear to be some agreement and I have attempted in the following section to
consider a selection of both generally accepted ideas and alternatives.

            Marr:ggitj.

            The word marrvgitj is a term applied to a person who relies upon familiar
spirits and divination for direction, who is thought of as working for the good of other
people, and who, in addition is likely to be someone with a highly developed
knowledge of practical medical treatments. As one man said,
            Marrvgitjhas djamarrku!.i', (literally= children) sometimes call them
      warrakan (animal), on shoulder, can be Dhuwa or Yirritja. The name marrvgitj is
      given to the person by the djamarrkuli' who talk to him/her and say, 'Come on
      we'll make you marr:ggitj".

            The same man said that,
          Alatha'alatha are children on Yirritja shoulder, something like Timor or
      Macassarmagic.

            The marr:ggitj is said to listen to the djamarrkuli', on his or her shoulder
and then he knows what to do. The djamarrkujj' can make a gara (spear) come out
from inside a person. They can also bring information to the marr:ggitjconcerning
other people, their actions and even their conversations when the marrvgitj is at a
different location, in a way almost identical with that described for the spirit familiars
of a European medium.

              The reputation of the marrugitj who is effective spreads far and wide
especially when there are known cures of serious problems. For instance I was told
that,
               W..'s older sister (a female marrI.Jgit.J) was living with B.. and that. M..
        went to her when he was real sick and she made him better. You pay $20 a visit
        Now she's gone to live at G... The balanda (white) doctors at Gove know her.
        G.. at Milingimbi was hit by nyera (sorcery) by Alice Springs yolIJu and he
        went baba'yun (mad) - she fixed him too.15

              Webb (1936) recorded that marrI)gitjwas the name of the spirit familiars
and quoted two stories of men who became marrvgitjby establishing relationships
with spirit familiars. Thomson, who made his observations in the late 1930s and early
1940s recorded (1961:97) that the medicine man was named to him as marrI.Jgitjmirri
(lit. man:ogitj-having). As he said,
               According to most of my informants, the cult of marrngitmirri or
        medicineman in eastern Arnhem Land is restricted to men only, and is not secret
        - that is, it does not depend on ritual or supernatural backing, and is carried out
        in open camp without any secrecy, in the presence of women and children.

              Whether there has been a change to allow women to become involved, or
whether such claims from the men are still their ideal it is not possible for me to
assess. Thomson also makes the note that marrI)gitjmirri were authentically from
North East Arnhem Land and that the galka (also called ragalk see below)"do not
occur among the same people" (p98) a statement he had made in disagreement with
Webb who had claimed that they did. Whatever the situation was in the 1940s, there is
no doubt that both types of practice are currently, and have been being used across the
whole ofYolIJu territory since at least as early as the 1960s.




15 Janice Reid (1983:64), appaiently referring to the same woman, says that her "skills are such that
she is visited by by patients from Milingimbi, Elcho Island and Yirrkala " Reid also refers (p65) to
concern expressed by one man over "rumours that the medical authorities were attempting to
persuade her to go and work at Darwin at Nhulunbuy Hospitals", and that the "doctors there might
be jealous of her powers and try to kill her".

            Galka

            According to Reid (1983: 84),

             Galka are a special type of sorcerer. They are specialists who have learned
      their trade and have privileged access to the realm of the dead and its powers."


            She suggests that while anyone could practice a wide range of sorcery

type activities, accusations of sorcery were only covertly made. In contrast to this

(p88) the

            galka can provide a convenient scapegoat when an internal killing
      threatens group solidarity: he is sometimes said to arrange his victim's death by
      suggesting, while the victim is in his thrall, that he go home and provoke a fight
      with a kinsman. In this fight the kinsman is killed.


            One informant said that the form of sorcery carried out by a galka is called

ragalk. Its specific intent is the death of the individual chosen as victim, and ragalk

may be the suspected cause if a person is killed by a crocodile or a rifle bullet.


            In contrast to these more popular associations with the term, one very

senior man told me very quietly that a galka was really a man chosen to carry out a

stealthy revenge killing. He said that there were always senior and experienced men

moving about on religious business and it was no-one's business to inquire as to their

activities, so it was easy for one of these men to be chosen for the task. He would

simply go away on religious business, carry out a stealthy killing, give time for the

excitement to cool down and then one day simply return from his religious journey,

anything up to three or four months after the death, and be very surprised about the

news when it was relayed to him.




            Nyera.

            Nyera appears to be a general term for a wide range of activities that can

be considered as different forms of magic or sorcery. It is used to cover such practices

as attracting another's love, attracting rain, for hunting magic, to kill a person, to cause


                                               56
                                                         Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

sickness or madness, or to weaken an enemy before fighting. It can involve singing,

particular actions, and the use of objects and substances any of these being considered

effective alone but there is the indication that their combination is thought to increase

their effectiveness. So nyera appears to be a word with a wider scope in meaning than

ragalkmentioned above.


            A number of different activities were described to me that were practiced

with the intention of winning the love of a member of the opposite sex. Only the first

of the three recorded here was actually named as being nyera, the others were simply

described. In this first practice a man sings for a woman and puts her name in the

song. It was said that this

            goes through the woman's heart like wind, and then she wants that man.


            Sometimes a man will sing this type of song with friends. It was also said

that a woman can make a nyera song for a man. The second practice involved a man

making a fire in the bush.

            When his smoke goes right up straight, his spirit goes up in 1he smoke
      and a woman sees it and goes straight to it.


            The third love magic practice appeared to be more concerned with

establishing a permanent relationship than with a short liaison. To use this,

            a man digs a hole and washes his clothes into the hole and sings for a
      woman to marry him, and then puts the clothes on. Then the woman will come
      straight to him and then they will get properly married.


            Substances Used in Tapping Power.

            Various substances-are thought of as having considerable effect in sorcery

as has already been indicated by some of the above descriptions. One, considered to

be very powerful is betjIJu or woja. This is dried heart blood from a person or an

animal which can be used for hunting or for killing by sorcery. As it was described,

            a galka or a man collects heart blood. To use for hunting for turtles or fish
      he throws a little bit on the water. For hunting in the bush you heat a little in fire
      and rub it across the body. Then only one shot and not miss. Or you can rub it
      on a spear and it will go straight.


                                               57
                                                        Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

            For killing a man the efficacy of wola can be combined with a sting ray

spine. To use this,

             you tie up your arm and then put wola first and then the spine on your
      hand and point it at a man. Then a mokuy will push the spine into that person
      like lightning.


            According to this practice it is also possible to gain through nyera either

the active participation of spirits, or the control of power of some kind, though I was

not able to clarify which of these was thought to occur. Other substances were also

used and it was said that,

            Djirritjirri is different. It is something that you put in tea to make yourself
      attractive to women. It is a sort of munatha (earth or soil) from Roper or Rose
      River country (Just outside of YollJu territory) and is magic.
            Another miyalkpuy girri (woman-concerned with substance) is like a
      stone. You scratch some off and put it in a womans tea.


            From the above descriptions it can be seen that the range of ideas

concerning available "power" and ways of tapping and using it are quite wide. There

is a range of practices where there appears to be simply an undefined power at work.

In some there may be the use of substances which are thought to have magical

efficacy if used in an appropriate context. In others there is understood to be an

attribution of positive or negative function to these practices according to whether their

actions are helpful or destructive. For example, djamarrkuli were described as

removing a sharp object from a person, so therefore could be thought of as helpful,

and as carrying out a positive function. Mokuy, in contrast to this, were described as

available to pierce a person with a sorcery object, and thus carry out a destructive and

hence a negative function. Neither the negative nor positive functions can be equated

absolutely with Yoll)u notions of good or evil as such practices are relative to the

persons carrying them out and those on the receiving end, though there is a generally

expressed dislike of the negative, which appears to have become much more openly

expressed since the Revival.




                                               58
                                                            Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

                Ancestral Power.

                In addition to the above ideas of power that is available for use, there is
    thought to be what Morphy (1984:19-20) describes as "the spiritual power of the
    Ancestral beings" which he says is,
                thought to affect individual's lives and contribute to their well being. As a
          person grows older and participates in more and more ceremonies he or she
          establishes a continuing relationship with the clan's Ancestral beings. In
          ceremonial contexts the power of the Ancestral beings, which is objectified in
          the sacred objects and paintings, can be transferred to participants through
          having their designs painted on their bodies and having the power words of the
          songs sung over them. Thus, as they grow older, people accumulate spiritual
          power.

                Such ancestral power is thought to reside in the traces left by the ancestors
    and hence, when these are in the form of pigment deposits, also to reside in the
    pictures painted with them. (cf. Morphy 1984:73). I have on occasion been shown
    small pieces of such pigments by men who handle them with what could be described
    as reverence worthy of something of extreme value.

                There seems to be a very real contrast between this kind of power and that
    generalised sort of power that is tapped in the above described sorcery type practices.
    The power of the ancestral beings, to continue using Morphy's term, seems to be
    associated more with a group's identity, their sites, and their eternal existence. It would
    appear to be something of this nature that is considered as being handled when they
    are handling the ravga (sacred objects), the traces, or even naming their "inside"
    names, so that in handling them it could be interpreted that they are handling not
    simply a respected power, but their own personal reality, their "identity" in a tangible

I   form. It is not surprising then the degree of reverence which some men express

l   towards the slightest expression of it.

                It appears also that there may be some consideration that this form of
    power is able to be tapped by the dalkarramirri (Yirritja religious specialist) through
    the songs that they sing, as exemplified in the following description from
    Djangirrawuy, which I will include without further comment here,

                                                   59
                                                               Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

              When I'm sitting with a man and he's dying, the first thing I do, (when
       he's losing wind and suffering), is sing wata (wind), bumnalala (cyclone). With
       that song I'm trying to bring that wind, breath back to him.
              If he loses and passes away and lies back on his elbow (likan .gayi Ji
       djipthun) like broken branch, sing mayku (barrukaladharpa [paperbark tree]).
       Instead of saying, "He's gone", I sing the song that says, "He's resting in
       peace", and in that song mention the places and announce with my spirit where
       his spirit has gone. My mind and feelings are magayin.yur(with the sacred
       things).
              Next I sing "guku", (my spirit turning into guku (honeybee)andflying).
       The song tells where he's started and then his journey as guku.
              Then sing mokuy ([spirit being named]Murayana). Same thing. He looks
       for sugar bag and goes on journey. (like spirit of the deceased looking for hive).
       Murayana combines to guku (honey) and wata (wind).1':/ayi Ji wandirri, mokuy
       (He runs about, the dead one) and wind gal.ya buma (blowing on his skin) and
       dhupuma (walk along looking upwards) for sugar bag.
              After mokuy, singing about "marr' 16(a man's deepest desires and
       feelings, likened to string), but singing about the string called Ya[iyajj and Riitja.
       That string from Djarrakpi links to Martjanba and be.yur(from there to) Cape
       Shield. The words of the song are:
              Miirrdja .yarra weyin.yuminiy, nhakuna Riitja bugu.fthun, (my innermost
       desires belong stretched out long like the string Ratja)
              Yajiyaji {MWJgalili), Gulunguma (MWJgalili), (string names for MaI]galili
       clan)
              Marrtji (It goes) ijurruwalma, GandaIJuwala, Gurilkawala, (names of
       channel between Elcho and Matjaka)
              Wiripunydja (Other ones) Rrimbitja, Garrtju!u!a,Dhamburrthamburr,
       MalaIJarri, (Wessel islands places)
              Gamalwala, Wu!WJaniwala. (Cape Shield places).
              Special names for the places linked to the dead person, like the long string
       Y aliya[i. that links these places. It is a Guwak (bird species) that links his
       yiiku.(name) Marr.yu (possum) also climbs through that rope. By singing the
       song, its like praying how much we love that mokuy (dead person). Our love is
       long like the long string. It doesn't help the mokuy (dead person), it helps our
       beliefs.
              We perform in a special way, making burJgul (ceremony)and manikay
       (song) so we feel comfort instead of hard feelings or jealousy. He or she is dead
       and already magayin (sacred), and the body is respected like a magayin
       (sacred)object.
              Church is a different story, but if in the house, can't move the body
       without ceremony. It's like the body being there turns that place into a .yiirra
       (sacredshelter)place.
              The first five songs to start are bumna[ala (cyclone), dharpa/mayku
       (paperbark tree), guku (birrkuga [bee species]), mokuy (dead person) and Riitja
       (particular ritual string). Dharpa/mayku and guku/birrkuga tells the dead person
       that he's already objectthirra (Ceased to be a human and become a sacred
       object).Those songs also indicates and tells people that person is dead. rm
       sitting close to him and I'm the only one who knows yet. I get the clapsticks and
       sing those five songs.
              These five songs also form like a map section for the mokuy (dead
       person) to follow, which and where we announce his journey to special place.

16 Mibrinterpreted by Thomson (1975) and others apparently following him as power would often
be better described as having power rather than as being power. The notion that it is "power" restricts
its domain of meaning and pr00uces a miss-emphasis. It is frequently referred to by the analogue of
string or rope (rala) as is done in this quote and in Thomson (1975:8) The analogue is expanded
more fully in the following chapter. It was described to me as emotions and feelings that connect a
man with, among other things, his sacred things.


                                                     60

      For us that song "Djarr", (dhupuma l)ayi dhu mokuy [walking along looking
      upward he will, the dead one]), he's looking at honey hole. (For me that honey
      hole is djiwarr[heaven]). It's called Djiirr. (I come fromBurrumIJur).


             This quote gives clear indication of the belief in power available in

association with the act of singing. This power is not defined but linked to the inner

side of reality in the sacred dimension, and controlled in part by the use of and

manipulation ofanalogical reference.

          RELATIONS WITH THE INSIDE OF REALITY

                 THROUGH THE RELIGIOUS SYSTEM

              Having looked briefly at some of the perceived ways of tapping power, I

now turn to a consideration of some aspects of relationships with the inner side of

reality. In looking at the ways YolIJu do this through the religious system, I have

chosen to restrict discussion in several ways. In particular, the different vehicles for

religious knowledge, by means of which the inside of reality is experienced are

skimmed with extreme brevity before concentrating the rest of the section onto one

form, the narration of myth. I examine some of the ways in which myth is used as an

example of the ways in which all the forms are potentially able to be used. These

include the ways in which information about the inside reality is restricted or released,

the ways the religious system functions, and the ways in which control o.f the society

is maintained in the hands of a few senior religious specialists.


              Vehicles of Religious Know ledge.

              The Y oluu experience of the eternal cosmos is represented in a variety of

forms. These include narrative or myth, song-poetry, dance and two and three

dimensional representations such as painting and sculpture 17 · Each of these forms

represents a different vehicle of religious knowledge. In Yoluu thought knowledge of



l 71t would also be true to say that as all named things in the outside world are are transformations
of elements of the inside of reality, then the whole cosmos and every discrete element of it becomes
an unbounded vehicle of religious knowledge.


                                                     61
                                                         Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

any of these forms equates to religious experience associated with them, for
knowledge of anything means to have experienced that thing, and knowledge of the
inside reality means to have experienced that inner side of reality. The various vehicles
of religious know ledge are then the means of passing on the corporate experiences of
the society, and in one way or another, a means of entering into those corporate
experiences.

            Concerning dance, Williams (1986:44) makes the point that dancing is
much more than a re-enactment. She says that,
            During their performance dancers are demonstrating their identification
      with the spirits important to their group, and with each performance they acquire
      more of their essence, become more like them.

            On the assumption that she is correct, dance, for the Yoluu, becomes an
experiential mode of learning to know, and a vehicle which brings them into closer
relation with the inside reality of their own eternal "inside" identity.

            The paintings of two dimensional representations, whether on the human
body, on bark, or on the surface of other representations, is an experiential contact. In
the actual process of painting there is a contact with the ochres (which are traces of the
ancestral being) and hence a handling of one transformation of the actual being. Of
more significance however is the sense that the production of a painting (or the act of
being painted) is a coming into contact with (or of actually becoming, in the latter
case) a new transformation of the entity being painted. As it becomes manifest in a
new "outside" expression of the "inside" reality, the men involved are actually
expressing their own power, the power of their own "identity" as they produce this
transformation. When painting or three dimensional objects are being produced in an
"inside" ceremonial context then, the experiential awareness of the "knowing of the
entity", the invisible rlJ()ga (sacred items) and of the reality of their own "identity" is
                             ~



heightened to an extreme level, the most intense of the religious experiences. One
Yol1Ju leader attempting to explain some of the significance of this experience said,



                                                62
                                                              Chapter 2 - The Eternal Cosmos.

            You can't see the ravga, but the objects show and reveal. The varaka
      (core) of wood refers to the actual original object, and to the mystery handed on
      by the ancestral spirit.

             As far as songs are concerned, I have had an older man complain to me
that the young men, instead of coming to know them properly through learning them
in a ceremonial context, and by listening to them on a succession of ceremonial
occasions, are learning them from tape recordings, so don't know them properly. It
appeared to me that in this there could have been either a contrast being made between
knowing experientially in the proper context, which was real knowing, and gaining
head knowledge, which was not real knowing, or alternatively a contrast between
simply knowing words and tune and knowing of "proper style" 18.

             In these ways the vehicles of religious knowledge are expected to
communicate that knowledge experientially and they are considered to do this most
effectively only when this occurs in the correct religious context.

      Myth as a vehicle for recording the establishment and
                maintenance of relations between groups.

             A further aspect of the maf!.ayin (sacred) items, particularly those
analogous to natural species is that in the myths they are frequently said to make
journeys themselves. For example there is a story about a dog named Djuranydjura
that comes from Gupapu~u country called Djiliwirri, visits several sites on the way
but is following the smell of whale that was coming from Nauinburra at the far
Northern end of Elcho Island. When he reached that point, he tasted whale and
immediately started to talk Warramiri language (when he had previously spoken
Gupapu~u).


              I have chosen this story firstly because it is very short, but secondly
because it was told to me in a specific teaching session from one of the men as an


18 there is also perhap' the implication that then the control of such knowledge was being retained
in the hands of those whose right it was to control it


                                                    63

example to help me understand stories in general. Djuranydjura, in this story, is a dog.
It can in fact be described as the name of an "ancestral dog" which has belonged to the
Gupapu~u clan for a long time.


             In the story as it was explained, the name Djuranydjura is not referring
simply to a dog that makes a journey but to a ceremonial item of that name which is a
major element of the Gupapuy:ou clan's identity, and to one or more representatives of
the clan itself. The story, according to my Yol:ou tutor, tells that at some time in the
past, a man or men of the Gupapuy:ou clan saw that there was an advantage to be had
by establishing a relationship with the Warramiri clan who have "whale" as one of
their major ceremonial items. That is they "caught the smell of whale and followed the
scent". They travel to Na:oinburra where they "taste" whale. That is they establish a
relationship with one branch of the Warramiri. This relationship is in some way
associated with each group sharing details of their sacred items so that each knows the
other through experiencing (tasting) the presence of the spiritual entity involved and
the "dog" (Gupapuy:ou clan) and the "whale" (Warramiri clan) are exposed to each
other. Now as a result, the particular section of Warramiri clan that was involved has a
dog ravga. It is however not named Djuranydjura, but Buru:ogitj and Gurrumiya.

             There is the implication with the exchange of these items that there is also
an exchange of the spiritual entities that each group controls, with those spiritual
entities being affiliated with the locations represented by those groups.19

              It can be seen from this that what appears to be the story of the journey of
a "totemic" animal, dog, from one place to another is a record of the establishment of a
complex set of relations between clans through the exchange of spiritual entities told
in analogical terms and which may also involve the migration of a section of the
Gupapu~u people.        The implications of the way and the context in which I was told


19 There is also the possible record in this story, carried in the suggestion of "eating" a euphemism
for copulation, that in this establishment of relationships, arrangements were made for one group,
(presumably the Warramiri) to give their daughter's daughters to the other as mothers for their
children.

this story is that the majority if not all such narratives of the travels of magayin (sacred

objects or identities) from one place to another are similarly oral histories of the

establishments of such relationships told in the guise of the travels of natural species

in "ancienttimes".


             If this type of interpretation is applied more broadly it would be possible

to interpret the major myths of the travels of DjaIJ'kawu and of Barama as both the

history of the step by step movement of a religious cult with its set of objects

including myths, songs and dances across the country and the establishment or

affirmation of a set of interclan relationships by the sharing of a single aspect of the

"inside identity". The Wawilak myth is quite different as regards the step by step

movement, but can be similarly interpreted as an exchange of and establishment of

relationships. In their case this is concerned with a relationship between the Wawilak

people and those further north.


             The Arnhem Land political scene is one of constant flux in the

development of and breakdown in relationships and the constant speaking out of such

narratives is one way of calling on the past in order to influence the present.20. There

is potential within the religious structure for the continuous extension of the

"journeys" of these beings as they appear to function as tools or documents of

established relationships. Williams ( 1986. 38-39) refers to one technique for the

extension of such relationships by the "discovery" that a certain item already exists in

another group's territory. Such a new revelation can then be used as basis for

recognising that the journey of the spirit-being has incorporated that territory and the

myth will be extended to incorporate it also. Such justifications are easily considered

to be something that the ancestors knew but which had been forgotten and

rediscovered.




20 Actual examples of the use of one myth in this way are given in Chapter 7.

             It is just as easy to work the "discovery" out the other way round as I
have described in the story of Djuranydjura and start with an exchange of sacred
items, their associated songs and meanings. Whichever basis is used, myth
automatically becomes a vehicle for the recording of such exchanges and of the
consequent relationships involved.

             Myth can be communicated through any of the different vehicles of
religious knowledge, but here I am considering only the narrative form. As I have just
demonstrated without actually discussing this particular aspect of Yo4Ju mythology, a
myth has the superficial appearance of being a straightforward narrative, but carries
with it a number of esoteric references which are communicated to those who have
previously been given keys to open the particular levels of reference.

             It is never possible to be certain that one has acquired the innermost levels
of meaning, nor even the keys to them, and there is an understanding intimated by
many informants that these levels of meaning are known only by the few very senior
ceremonial leaders. The Myth of the Turtle Harpoon Rope discussed in Chapter 3 is
shown to have a number of different interpretations. While three separate analogues of
the story were available, I am led to believe that there are further levels of analogue,
but these were not revealed to me, and I do not know whether there is only one further
level or more than this. All that can be said of that at present is the standard Yol:uu
answer in the situation, that, JYalapal mar:vgi. (The old people know)21.

             The Dja:g'kawu story recorded earlier in this chapter is probably never
narrated in total and there are outside and inside versions which only vary from each
other in terms of details of the contents. Closely linked to the myth are the song cycles
of which each clan has its own version. One collection of 188 of verses of the more


21 This expression is ambiguous and can refer to either living or deceased "old people".


                                                    66

eastern clans' versions of these songs were published in an English translation by

Berndt (1952). In the north east of the YollJu territory the general outline of the myth

appears to remain basically the same irrespective of version, and all versions appear to

have the similar ranges of analogically carried meanings. Variation in content appears

to be related to the context of narration and more specific details may be included or

even excluded to match the intent of the narrator in terms of meanings being

communicated.


            Apart from the valid meanings of the surface level of the narrative, there

are other sets of meanings carried within the myth by means of a combination of

analogue and the relationships between the elements of the story. Each level of

interpretation is then able to be understood only as the meanings of the key elements

for that level are revealed. Berndt ( 1952) describes the meanings of some of the key

elements at one level which enable the myth to be interpreted as a presentation of

human sexuality and fertility filled with poetic descriptions of copulation, pregnancy

and childbirth. On the basis of the interpretation of this level of meaning Berndt claims

that this is a myth fundamentally concerned with fertility, both of humans and of

nature, with an emphasis on the maintenance of the fertility of the natural world.


            His interpretation of this analogue is true to Yol1Ju interpretations, but

whether his analysis of this myth as being a presentation of the Yol:ou role in the

maintenance of the earth's fertility is a valid proposition or not, I have no answer,

except that I have never heard the Yol1Ju refer to such maintenance even by allusion.

Berndt however claims (ibid.12) that both the Dja:o'kawu and Wawilak are "concerned

with sexual functions and with peculiarly female characteristics" and that the

Dja:o'kawu are "concerned with procreation", while the Wawilak are "interested in

maintaining the status quo". He also claims that Warner "wrongly assumed that it [the

Dja:o'kawu myth] was mereJy one part of a larger cycle of stories centring around the

movements of the ocean tides, and the floods of the rainy season".

             The problem with such conclusions is that they assume to be the correct
interpretation, when each is only one of a whole series of equally valid interpretations.
It all depends on the level of keys one examines as to the interpretation of the narrative
with which one is confronted, and no correct interpretation can claim to be more valid
than any other correct one. In the Djau'kawu complex there is the level that Berndt
describes where the analogue is a sexual one. In addition to this there is a level of
interpretation in which the myth is a record of the establishment of relations between
clans, and another level which describes the movement of a cult across Arnhem Land.
This is concerned with the progressive movement of cult objects in the form of
anthropomorphic sculptures called Djau'kawu from one clan centre to the next. When
a connection is drawn between this process and the previously discussed movement
of the different ma.Qayin from place to place, and it is recognised that this is frequently
spoken of in analogical terms as the ebb and flow of tides or rivers, it is well feasible
that Warner's (1958:335) analysis is an equally correct one.

             A further interpretation is possible in w~ich the story is seen as being the
movement of spirit beings called Djau'kawu across Arnhem Land, beings who
establish a series of lesser beings (spirit children) at each site so that the set of these
lesser beings at each site form the spiritual identity of the clan. This analogue includes
a picture of Djau'kawu, represented by the constant use of digging sticks to dig
waterholes, copulating with the earth itself, so that the people being born are the spirit
children which have Djau'kawu as father and the "earth as mother". (Gondarra 1980).
Berndt ( 1952: 179) actually refers to one detail of this level without noting the
distinction in levels when he says of the neophytes in the :rjlirra. ceremony that "they
themselves are the rangga ".
                                                        ,
             Considered just from this relatively undetailed perspective, and counting
the surface narrative as one of them, there are no less than five separate and equally
valid sets of analogues. I would suspect that the last two described above are more
                            •
inside than the others on the simple grounds that things of the spirit appear to be

considered to be of more significance, and therefore further "inside" than things of the
flesh. However as I will attempt to show in later chapters associated with the Morning
Star and its transformations, things are not as clear cut as that.

              Over the years I have been given a key here and a key there with no
straightforward explanation that says, "These are the keys to such and such an
analogue". The result of this is that I am not able with any certainty to list the
analogues in any hierarchical format if such a hierarchy does in fact exist22. However
what does become obvious is that the sets of meanings are each analogues of the
other, and each set understood amplifies the richness of the whole. Equally obvious is
the fact that by the retention of the keys to any set of meanings it is possible to keep an
analogue completely hidden. This means that control over the keys to the analogues
gives complete control over the esoteric levels of religious knowledge.

              Control of Religious Knowledge.

              In traditional times the possession of and hence the control over religious
knowledge was, in the Yo4Ju society, equivalent to the control of that which formed
the basis for authority. The end result of this is that a few powerlul religious leaders
held ultimate control. In present day North East Arnhem Land, these religious leaders
still have a great deal of control in all spheres, but alternative power structures have
developed and their control is no longer total. In this section I am considering the
situation first from what is purported to be a pre-contact perspective.

              Keen (1978:385) has argued that the main ingredient of the older men's
control over the younger men is secrecy, but that that "secrecy would avail the men
nothing if what they kept secret had no intimate importance " He also suggests a
number of things which the older men control, that the secrecy enables them to
maintain control over. These are: control of the representations which enable men "to


22 If keys are revealed to initiates for one analogue at a time it would be possible to consider this
revelation of analogues in stages as a hierarchy, but this would not necessarily be a true
representation of Yo~u understandings.

    tap the power of the Beings", control of the esoteric know ledge centred on paintings
    and songs, control of "physical access to major parts of public ceremonies" and
    "control of sanctions to guard the secrecy of the ceremonies". It is, he suggests (p386)
    secrecy which gives the knowledge of these things a value, and it is this value which
    "gives those who control it power over others" and that they are able to achieve this
    control over others, "by offering or withholding valued knowledge".


I
'
                These things that Keen suggests the men retain control over by secrecy,
    are the things that give status and authority in both the "inside" and "outside" spheres.
    They are also the things that enable a man to enter into a full appreciation of and
    appropriation of his "identity". It would appear to be the desired access to these, and
    perhaps the fear of being deprived of them which ultimately provides the motivation
    for the younger men to submit to the older men's control. In the past, the control of
    religious knowledge was not the only sanction, and the use of physical violence,
    murder and sorcery appear to have ~en common means of backing up the authority
    gained by secrecy. Nevertheless it appears that the control ofreligious knowledge of
    various kinds was the most significant means of social control.

                For any young man, upward mobility was only possible if he had
    appropriate patronage, and this was easier to obtain if his own father was a man of
    prestige. The position of greatest favour was normally that of the eldest son, though
    for various reasons, and not uncommonly, another son may be given priority. One
    young man told me that in his clan, his grandfather's eldest son (who had been the heir
    apparent) had formed a liason with one of the old man's wives. As a result, the
    grandfather had passed on the religious knowledge of all the sacred things to the
    second son. That second son was my informant's father. His father had passed on
    most of the knowledge to his eldest son, but as that brother was involved in
    inappropriate behaviour, my informant claimed that the knowledge (held in store by
    other older men) would eventually pass to him. This was as he saw it and not

necessarily true in the eyes of other men in the clan, but nevertheless gives some idea
of how the system of patronage can function.

            It is also possible to seek patronage as another man explained. If he
wanted to gain knowledge, he would go out of his way to make a selection of gifts to
a man whose knowledge he desired. These would include such things as meat from
the hunt, well made weapons, turtle rope or harpoon, or even a canoe (considered to
be an item of high value). He said that he would not ask for anything, but that the
older man would consider the gifts and at an appropriate time would decide that, "I
must teach that young man something". Nowadays such gifts can include such things
as store food, cash, four wheel drive vehicles or even large inboard motor boats and
younger men are beginning to count the cost of involvement in new ways.

            More senior men are constantly watching less senior men, especially their
own sons to see if they are behaving appropriately, or are "just rubbish" and one
example of this is given in Chapter 4 where I describe the approach of a father who
said that he watched his son to see if his behaviour was appropriate to warrant him
being given knowledge at the first level. So it was in all aspects of Yoluu society prior
to contact. The old men's control gives the appearance of having been absolute. There
was no alternative for a young man. Either he concurred or he was deprived of status
and possibly even of his life. Nowdays control is not so absolute, except in the arena
of traditional religion. The communities no longer have just the single domain of
authority. Western government structures, based on the religions of materialism and
capitalism, have been accessed by the younger men on the basis of their superior
knowledge in this domain, particularly in English and Mathematics.

            While, at Galiwinku, the young men still defer many decisions to the
senior men, by having control over this new form of religious knowledge, they have
become part of, and leaders in, an alternative power structure. In the communities
.there is now also an indigenous Christian church. Here again is another distinct power
structure, with much of the knowledge accessible only to those who are literate.

             In both these new structures there is still deference to the senior men. In

both this has led to some personal conflicts. However in the church with the new
experiences of the Adjustment Movement and the Revival both of which had a strong
reliance on new revelations and on personal experience, the old men appear to have
retained some authority while they depend on the younger men to do the work.

             THE TWO REVIVALS.

             In 1979 there was one revival, but now there are two. In that year the
Revival began in a small fellowship meeting where, as it was described to me,
           "We were singing and praying together when suddenly we all became
      aware of the presence of God, the Holy Spirit. We became aware of how sinful
      we were and how wonderful he was and we seemed to all begin crying, and
      confessing our sins and praising God all at the same time".

             The excitement of that initial experience was contagious, and people in
rapidly increasing numbers began to meet each night for "fellowship" with each other,
but seeking also to experience this new revelation of the Holy Spirit23. As these
meetings developed, they took on a consistent pattern of beginning with an extensive
time of singing of choruses that seem to be mostly of a "happy" type, and some of
which were simply fun songs. At some point a leader introduced the second phase of
the evening by announcing that the meeting would start. He would then lead those
gathered in several choruses of a more worshipful type. Following these came any
announcements, bible readings and teaching or preaching. After the preaching came
the most important phase of the meeting. People were called to the front to form a
circle, singing of worshipful choruses commenced and there was an expectation that
during this phase of the meeting, the Holy Spirit would meet with some people. This
was nearly always but not inevitably seen to happen as some moved to the centre of
the circle, often weeping for their sin, or grieving over some member of the family
who had not yet met the Holy Spirit nor mended their ways. Once in the centre they


23 There is a great diversity of explanation concerning how the Revival started. The majority of
versions however locate the original experience in some relationship with the evangelist Kevin
Rrurrambu and his family (See Bos 1988:72).

 would be prayed for by one of the elders and then return to a place in the circle. This
 activity continued until there were no more people who felt the need to go into the
· circle for prayer and then the meeting was abruptly closed24.


              This with little variation has now become the structure of all "services"
 and "fellowship meetings". It is also the structure of the meetings at the annual
 ''Thanksgiving Weekend", except that the second phase is extended by a succession of
 musical or dramatic items presented by a variety of clan groups or groups of visitors
 from other centres. It appears inevitable that in every case there are the three phases.
 First a phase which is treated as "before beginning", a second phase which contains
 all the types of activities that were common in a Western style church service, and then
 the third phase when the participants move into what can well be described as an
 experiential meeting with God. 25 With the Yoluu understandings of the nature of
 transformation it doesn't appear to matter which terms are used in this context and
 there is no major distinction made between God, the Father, the Holy Spirit and Jesus,
 as there is an equivalence relationship between them..

              The three phases of the meeting do not appear to have developed as a
 result of conscious choice, but I find it interesting that there is an almost exactly
 analogous structure in the qualities of these three stages and in the three major stages
 of transformation through which the Yoluu progress in the passage through life (see
 Chapter3).

              When this Revival was at its height it was considered by most of the
 Yo~u    to be a unique experience. Now, however, as there has been time for reflection,

 a number of Yo~u have begun to look back to the "First Revival". In doing this they
 are referring to events that occurred in 1957 which were called "An Adjustment


 24 Bos (1988:85t) gives more extensive details of the types of contents of these meetings, and a
 sli2hdy different analysis of their structure.
 2S"1t would be possible to diviae the second phase into three stages, identifying them as, prayer
 choruses, business and preaching, which would make the transformation structure a more complete
 fit, but as this would not necessarily reflect Yoluu conscious ways of looking at the structures, I
 have retained only the obvious divisions.

Movement in Arnhem Land" by Berndt, who asserted (1962:24) that this was

"primarily an attempt to integrate the 'traditional' Aboriginal world with the outside

world", and that it had a "strongly political flavour".26


             This "movement", led primarily by three men, BataI,Jga, Walalipa and

Burrumarra, culminated in the bringing "outside" of a number of secret-sacred cult

objects, to where they could be seen by all, and setting them in a concrete base

adjacent to the church building. While Berndt attributes a primarily economic

motivation to Burrumarra, and he appears to have been the least significant of the three

prime movers, he quotes him as saying (p40) that,

            The Bible came to our hearts and to our minds - it spoke of graven
      images, and we thought of our raIJga. The word of God made us ashamed.
      Could we keep our laws? Could we hide our raIJga? The bible was here. Instead
      we must show these raIJga to all: to men, women and children. We must do this
      instead of hiding them. And we began to think of the Memorial. 27


             In the current process of looking back the Y olIJu are linking what

·happened during the 1979 Revival to the events of 1957. It is interesting to notice here

that this process oflooking back to something earlier for justification and to

authenticate the present was a process also going on in 1957. As the people brought

out the raIJga then, they claimed that they were restoring something that had been lost

when the raIJga were stolen by the men from the DjaIJ'kawu women. Berndt (ibid.66)

records Burrumarra as saying that the following argument was used at the time,

apparently to calm the women's fears,

            It is all right for you to see these raIJga. It's been too much on one side,
      only men and no women. They made this serious and shameful for women. But
      the old people are to blame, they changed a situation in which women could see
      these things and participate in their ritual. Before the old people made it what it
      became, the Laindjun and the DjaI,Jgawul had it for everybody




26 My own interpretation of thi; would exactly reverse Bemdt's interpretation in that it appears more
to me as an attempt to integrate the outside world to the Aboriginal world by controlling the
relations between the two.
27 As I understand it, the Yol:gu use of the word 'Memorial' in this quote means simply a 'place to
put the ra:gga in the open' and did not, and still does not have anything like the normal implication
of the word's use in English.

              In the 1979 Revival and in the current church situation it is worthy of

notice that it is the sons ofBataI.)ga and Walalipa who have been the leaders, and that

Burrumarra's sons have had comparatively little involvement even though they are half

brothers to BataI.)ga's sons, having the same mother. BataI.)ga's eldest son, DayIJumbu,

speaking mostly in English attempted to explain to me how he saw the two Revivals

as being related together in the following way,

             One story about my own experience of the revival bulu (again) I was
      blessed by the Holy Spirit on that time in the time of Revival, and that was really
      blessing for me, to open up my heart to open up my eye, my spiritual eye, to see
      Christ clearly, and the Revival helped to fill me up with the DhuyuBirrimbir
      (Holy Spirit) with, like that, excitement, that's what I experienced at that time.
      I'm just talking about my own experience on Thanksgiving Time. In that way
      the revival helped me but it also helped me to see the times of my own father,
      that those old people already have the same blessing as we have, it was the same
      blessing but it was only for a short time, those liya- magayinmim28 old people,
      they would get together and praying and singing and praying and singing they
      would, they would sing the hymns that the missionaries had taught them, from
      the methodist hymn book and they were very much blessed. It was like that for
      those old people they were very much blessed by the Holy Spirit. That was
      those old people's Revival. They had the first Revival, before we had the
      Revival. And you can see the differences. Their Revival they dhawapnara.yal
      (made come out) the magayin (sacred things), ra.yga (ritual objects). They
      brought them out from the secret IJtirra (secret ceremonial area), riili (to here), to
      the outside. They brought them out because God was using them, their liya
      (heads), their djal (desires) their IJayaIJu (emotions), they would bring out
      everything.
             This is what they were thinking, God was saying, if they bring them out
      then for the near future, then "Your children will be blessed too" like that. God
      used them in that way so that we would be blessed, therefore we received the
      second blessing in our Revival and they received the earlier blessing from God
      at that time. I was only little, young, before I was married, I watched my father
      preaching to those old people there, "And that the story for you all", and when
      he prayed he would raise his hands up in the air towards God djiwarr'lil
      (towards heaven) and after that he would pray. He wouldn't pray the way we
      do, my father (His name is Ba!aIJga), he used to put his hands up in the air
      before he prayed for the old people. And I saw what happened with them, they
      were blessed and happy and used them in different ways, they would feel the
      presence of God there. I saw it. This happened when I was still young and I
      didn't understand it. I was very young. It was exciting with them and some of
      them were crying together when they received the blessing from God. And
      that's the story about that time and we should see it.
             And from this time I experience two Revivals, the Revival of the old
      people and now this time has a different experience he came into me because in
      the first one I didn't have the experience that they had those old people because
      they were liya-IJiirramirra mala (the ones having understanding of the secret
      ceremonial ground), liya-ra.yga'mirra mala (the ones having understanding of
      the sacred objects), and this time we received bulu (more) good blessing from
      God, that we all received,this time. And this time we all received the blessing, all
      the people. The difference is this, that just the old people were blessed in those

      Diirramirrwalal. (the ones having understanding of the secret ceremonial
      ground). Only those was blessed in those days. This time at thanks.giving time

             This process of adaptation/adjustment still continues in what appears to be
a conscious process of continually rethinking ideas to match Yol:uu intellectual
understandings to curreQ.t experience and practice. In the following quote, Rev
Djiniyini Gondarra describes how he, as a leader in the Northern Synod of the
Uniting Church, is constantly involved in doing just this.

            The missionaries30 said we have to leave the Yoluu way and follow
      Jesus, but that cut people off from their identity. The Spiritchallenged Paul
      about whether he was living like a Jew or a gentile. People respect my
      leadership because I separate between what the gospel says and wrong
      practices. For example, I enjoy traditional dancing and Christian dancing but I
      will have nothing to do with the Gunapipi [one of the rituals associated with the
      Wliwilak] and its sexual immorality.
            I am trying to contextualise Christianity into Yoluu society. The white
      contextualisation of the gospel becomes a bondage to Yoluu. The Lord opened
      my eyes to see that hidden context.
            I have been to Canada and Indonesia looking at contextualisation.
            Congress is not for hit and run evangelism but rooted into the life of the
      church. Need to take a new approach.
            It took a long time for the church to recognise Paul. Christ saw the value
      in people, but people don't see that they have something to give.

             It would appear from the above that the two revivals were, at least from
the Yoluu perspective, genuine experiences of reality, which for them meant
experiences of the inside reality that has always been. In 1989 there was continuous
effort on the part of at least some Yoluu to assess the relationship between what the

old people did in the "first revival", their experiences of the 1979 Revival, and the
ongoing course of the "bringing outside" and in a sense the desacrilising of previous
"inside" elements. The new experiential knowing of the Revival is now being freely
and openly placed alongside the earlier knowledge of the ancestral beings and there


29Bemdt (1962) appears to hav~ either ignored or missed the aspects of the 1957 events which are
here descnbed in tenns of a genuine religious experience, and concentrated on analysing this First
Revival in tenns of social and economic aims.
30 the word missionary in this context was used as a generalisation for non-Aboriginal Christians.

have been a series of attempts on the part of Christian Yol:ou to re-interpret the old in

terms of the new.

            CONCLUSION~


            In this chapter I have sought to highlight Yol:ou perceptions of the inner

aspects of the cosmos. This has been shown to be concerned with an inside aspect of

reality which the Yol:ou recognise as having been revealed to them in the past through

experiential contact. A variety of entities have been discussed in association with this.

Some appear to exist in a state which overlaps both the outer an inner dimensions.

Thus "children" are both unformed, pre-identified humans and freely communicating

intangible beings, and mokuys are both post-death humans and independent intangible

beings. Other entities such as wa.yarr and "totems" appear to have a normally

intangible form, made tangible in special ceremonies. Among these latter, wa.yarrare

known to have distributed amongst the clans, sets of objects which are re:presentations

of themselves, and of lesser spiritual beings whose most outer transformations are

conceived of as being the natural species or various artifacts of everyday life.


            These representations then function as tangible evidence which should

only be handled, seen or refurbished in situations with an appropriate degree of

secrecy and respect. Such representations are linked to spiritual entities associated

with particular sites. Ownership of such representations is then incontrovertible

evidence of ownership of the related site. Shared ownership of related or similar

representations forms the documentation of relationships between clans and such

relationships are able to be established on the basis of an exchange of such

representations. One implication of this exchange, is that as the spiritual entities of the

inner side of reality can be both caused to manifest at ceremonies and also to be

exchanged between places, then man is able to a certain extent, to control contact with,

and the movement and manifestation of such beings. Once a relationship is established

by such an exchange the logic of an unchanging eternal verity enables the

interpretation that because a thing has been established it must be a manifestation of


                                               77

     the unchanging inside ofreality and therefore is not a change but a manifestation of
     what always was so.

                 Most valued for their function as a means of coming into relationship with
     the spiritual entities and one's own eternal destiny, the objectifications called Taf)ga are
     also the embodiment of layered meanings and of understandings of life itself, of the
     relations between clans, between the sexes, between mankind and the land, and
     between mankind and the inner side of the cosmos, and these aspects are all explored
     in the following chapters. The control ofthe layered meanings embodied in analogical
     reference, and its release on a gradual basis to men as they grow older, appears to be
 I
     the basis of the control structures of Yoluu society. It enables the maintenance of
j
,,
     ,control in the hands of a small number of senior religious specialists.

                 The most recent Yoluu experiences with the inside of reality through the
     two Revivals has led to a whole new series of understandings of it, and has caused
     some Yoluu to reach radically new perceptions of it. Some Yoluu have attempted to
     maintain a complete dichotomy between Revival experiences and traditional ritual,
     while yet being involved in both, some have remained completely aloof from the
     Revival altogether, while still others have tried to achieve a synthesis between them.
     The existence of the inner side of reality of the eternal cosmos has never been
     challenged. What is in question in Yoluu society is its nature.

            THE PASSAGE THROUGH LIFE.
            INTRODUCTION.

            In this chapter I consider the passage of the individual through society
from pre-conception to post death and in doing so, demonstrate and expand on the
relevance of cosmological perceptions discussed in the two previous chapters. I also
examine some conceptual areas that are relevant to this passage through life. The new
conceptual areas are those concerned with "whole" and "part" and "life" and "living".
Together with some aspects of the way living things are perceived to transform over
time, these are critical to the understanding of the later discussion. The discussion
moves from them to ideas of pre-conception existence, and then follows sequentially
through various stages of YolIJu understandings of the life cycle. This examination
includes an analysis of the analogical references to the life cycle contained in a myth
about the manufacture of turtle rope and its use in the hunt. Since this was first
published (Rudder 1980: 37) further understandings of its content and reference have
become available and these are explored here.

            Whole and Part.

            There appears to be a notion of equivalence between any item and any part
of that item. This was first explained to me during a discussion with YolIJU teachers
some years ago concerning the teaching of reading. We were trying to find a way of
describing, in the Yol:uu language, the process of building words from known
syllables. The word wakana was proposed by one of them as a possible translation for
"syllable" with its meaning as "a part" of something. It could be used to refer to a part
of anything such as a segment of an orange, part of a vehicle, or of a word. However,
in attempting to describe the process of putting wakana together to construct new
words we encountered a serious obstacle. Each wakana retained the identity of the
                            "'
word from which it had been separated, so describing the process of word building in



                                              79
                                                        Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.


this way, and using the term wakana to do so, was akin to trying to take two totally

different identities and put them together to form a completely new identity which had

nothing to do with the identities from which it was being constructed: a conceptual

impossibility.ta


              As the concept was described to me, "You take a stone, break off a piece.

The piece is wakana from the main stone. Maybe break off five or three or four

wakana off the stone, bqt all are the same." It could be applied to people, "father, son

the same wakana, body, face, foot are alike". This appears to be referring to the family

likeness which is seen to be patrilineally inherited, and both father and son are wakana

of the same patrilineal "identity". The concept incorporated in the word wakana (a

word not very widely used) has a very wide application, for it helps to explain the

ways in which parts of anything are understood to be equivalent to the thing of which

they are a part.


              The concept of equivalence between part and whole becomes relevant in

regard to the discussion of the human being and parts of the human. For example one

speaks of I (not my) name and I (not my) arm and so on. The notion of the human

spirit and human identity as each being part of and therefore equivalent to the

individual has particular relevance to this chapter. In other chapters the importance of

equivalence relationships between ancestral beings, traces of them left in the

landscape, and the ceremonial objectifications of them of different types is obvious.

This is not quantitative equality but qualitative equivalence. I


              It is a simple matter following the Yol:gu approach to perceive any part of

a man, visible or invisible, as able to function separately in any one of the


la This notion of a permanent relationship between any whole and its parts is different from the
perception of a whole made up from a number of discrete separately isolable parts each with its
discrete identity and each being able to be recombined with others to form a new identity.

1 This understanding of the relation between whole and part, when combined with the earlier
discussed notions of ttansfonnation provides, at least for the Yol:ou, a solution for the problem
which occupied so much of Levy-Bruhl's struggle to explain the logic of what he called
"participation" (1910 and 1975).


                                                     80
                                                  Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.


transformations that make up his identity, ·without any consideration that there has
been a change in his identity. Each transfonnation is him and he is each. Ramifications
of this concept associated with a group's identity and of an individual's identity in such
a group, whether it be clan, patriline, site or totemic affiliation are obvious. Each is
part of the whole, but each simultaneously is not just a representative of, or identified
with, but a manifestation of the other.

            Notions of Life and Living.

            It is too simplistic to suggest that the Yoliju distinguish a neat dichotomy
between living and non-living, and when they do actually use these categories there is
no neat correspondence between their use of these classifications and the way that the
tenns are used in English. Meaning, for each of these categories, is made neither clear
cut, nor bounded, but is contextually determined. Inanimate objects in some contexts
can be considered as having a quality of life that is outside the normal Western
category of living. Similarly animals can be seen to have life which is more than
animal in certain contexts (see below) and humans continue to exist when physical life

ceases. Again, that which is dead can be simultaneously understood to be alive with a
different quality of life from that perceived in the normal classifications of living.
There is however no clear distinction made between physical life and spiritual life (or
outside life and inside life), except through context. Thus the dead are dead, but still
alive in the sense of having transformed to the inside of existence. The effect of this
lack of a clear cut boundary between these two qualities has a range of results.

            I have demonstrated (Rudder 1983) that the Yoliju distinguish a series of
                                                                                            i
categories of different qualities of "living" which are reflected in different classes of
living things. These are classifications which apply to the "outside" existence in the
physical world. There is also what appears to be an indistinct awareness of a quality
ofliving which applies to "inside" existence. Inside existence is a concept of a quality
of life which overlaps or potentially overlaps all the other categories.The normal or


                                            81
                                                  Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.


outside categories of living things that are used, while not lexically identified, are
clearly distinguished by the Yotuu by describing their attributes. Considered in order
of increasing complexity, these are identified by the Yol:uu as follows, (the
terminology for each category being my own).

            "Non-living" =            "those things which do not move themselves",
                                      including the shells and bones of things that were
                                      once alive.
            "Life-having 1"=          those things which have movement or the power
                                      to affect humans, including the sun, rain, vehicles,
                                      fresh water, the sea and fire.
            "Life-having 2" =         those things having "the ability to breathe or to
                                      reproduce", including all plants and animals.
                                      (most of which have "tails")
            "Life-having 3" =         the life of humans who have emotions, are able to
                                      forgive others, and "have and keep laws while
                                      animals do not".

            One further category of living relates to $e quality of life relevant to the
"inside". It, like the others, is not lexically marked nor is it distinguished frequently
by more than context. Frequently it can be more consistently identified by implication
than by overt reference. While this implication is frequently carried through analogical
reference, the "inside" category of living extends beyond the extremes of the other
categories as well as overlapping all of them.

            The Transformation of Living Things.

            Plants and animals are recognised as having patterns of transformation
linked to their cycles of reproduction or replacement. The patterns are classified in
different ways. The stages are related to identified physical changes in appearance and
may be lexically marked, described by colour changes or identified by relating them to
changes in seasons or to other concurrently observable changes in the flora and fauna.
For example, Figure 3: 1. illustrates Galpagalpa's description of the life cycle of



                                            82

wanaga (the cycad palm, Cycas media) as it goes through the stages that he
recognised. In these there are three stages of maturity of the fruit on the plant and a
further three stages of fruit on the ground as it transforms from its state as a fruit to
assuming the state of a young plant. Throughout the full cycle it is known by the
general name for the plant, wanaga, so that while each stage is separately identified
and some are separately named,each is perceived to have its own characteristics, yet all
stages are still wanaga and do not change from that.


                                                             Three stages of fruit on tree

              Figure 3.1. Life cycle of the cycad palm

              Such tri-partite structures of classification were also shown to be used in
classifying the perceived life stages of four of the five species of turtles, the emu, and
at least one of the edible yams. By classifying the separate stages and considering each
as a transformation of the other rather than a series of points along a continuum, the
process of steady growth and change is classified out. When this is done it is possible
to consider each separate stage as a separate and different manifestation of the one
unchanging identity, a process facilitated by the notion described earlier whereby
whole and part are seen as in an equivalence relationship to each other.

              Where anything is recognised as moving through a transformation from
                              ..
one state of existence or expression to another, it potentially has a series of successive

                                                 Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.


named stages of development to the maturity (or completion) of any expression.
Where such stages are recognised it appears inevitable, judging from the records I
made, that for each expression there will be three and always three categories of
assessment within that expression, then beyond those three a transformation to some
new category. Examples of this three fold transformation ofidentity, as they apply to
the maturity of natural species are given in the three central columns of figure 3.2,
where each of the three stages is identified by a separate term

            The first column represents the perceived preexistence of an identity,
before it enters the outside or physical expression being considered in the
classification. The second column contains the first stage of the expression, and, for
the species where there was an egg before this stage, this stage is represented by a
hatchling. The central column represents a stage where the adult characteristics are
present but incomplete, and the fourth column contains the classification for the fully
mature stage, so columns two, three and four represent stages one, two and three of
the ordinary "outside" categories or stages of "living".

              The last column represents an entirely different kind of transformation.

This last column represents the classification of a different quality of "living". While it

is still named by the term for the adult, and still has its identity, it has something about

it which is beyond the normally expected focus of the ordinary categories, having
about it something of an anomalous state. An entity to fit into this column will have

the outward appearance of one in stage three, but will also demonstrate other

characteristics that indicate a transformation in the focus of its identity. For example,

an extremely large specimen may be perceived to be not just an animal or plant, but

simultaneously the presence or image of an unborn human being looking for its

mother to be. An animal that walks right into the camp and so displays human

characteristics even to the point of eating offered food is likely to be considered to be

the image of someone recently deceased. In either case, it is in an anomalous state of

being both animal and not animal. In this way that the focus of "natural species"

categories are able to some extent to slide into the categories of "human" while still

retaining their species identity.


              In all these cases of transformation the focus of the naming process is on

the naming of and the "identity" of the species rather than on individual specimens.

The individual is simply a representative of the species This appears to be the same as

the process in English, however the notions of whole and part are involved in the

Y ol\)u approach, as is the absence of both definite and indefinite articles, and the

almost complete irrelevance of number. 2


              If a particular tree is sacred through contact with ancestral beings or as a

trace of one of them, the question arises as to what happens to this sacred object when

the tree dies. The answer is that when one tree dies, it is not the identity that dies,




2 Very few nouns in the language have a discrimination between singular and plural forms. For
example each cycad tree in a grove is warraga and the whole grove is warraga, what is named is
simply the identity of a species, or a better way to say that is to speak of the species having an
identity and in this case it is named warraga.

simply one specimen of it, and the sacredness will, over time, be automatically
attributed to another specimen of the same identity. In this way there are pandanus
trees (a relatively short-lived tree) associated with Banumbirr (the morning star) and
others with the Dj~'kawu that continue to be associated with those entities long after
the original specimens would have died. The identity continues through periodic
seedling replacements in the ongoing unidirectional transformations of the identity.

               The human life cycle is in a similar way broken into a series of recognised
stages. Some of these are lexically marked and the transitions between them are, or at
least appear to be, socially acknowledged through rites of passage. There appears
however to be no totally clearcut relationship between the recognised physiological or
social stages of development and those stages of ritual status which are the potential
for any individual male, although this relationship seems to be implied by Warner
(1937/58:125-137). It is to a consideration of these recognised stages of
transformation of the human life to which the remainder of this chapter is devoted.

               HUMAN LIFE CYCLE.

               Before one can consider the Yol:uu perception of the human life cycle, it is
necessary to remember that here also there are notions of both an "outside" physical
life and an "inside" life. It is possible to identify from a variety of sources statements
that indicate that an individual's life is considered to exist prior to conception , and that
growth continues after death. 3 It is also possible as Wamer does (1958: 126) to make

a separation between a man's ordinary life and his ritual life. He gives two tests for a
man's status in each of them. I outline these two different ways of looking at the life
cycle briefly before considering some of the aspects in more detail.




3 Stages that are of sign!ficance in a ritual sense are rePJ'C§ented analogically in mrth and in a consistent
pattern of rituals that celebrate or denotate those stages of maturity that are of religious importance.

              Conception, is noted in a number of sources (see the following sections)

as having two different aspects which are usually described in terms such as

physiological and spiritual. The Yoluu are not ignorant of physiological parentage,

though in conversation they tend to ignore it and concentrate on what to them are the

more significant religious ideas relating to the establishment of identity .4


              Childbirth, traditionally women's business is normally now a hospital

occurrence and a child is as likely to be delivered by a male nurse or doctor as by a

female nurse or doctor, a situation which currently appears to be accepted as normal

by the whole community.


              Early childhood appears to be the time of life with the most differentiation

of physical stages and the time of least focus on religious significance. The stages of

childhood growth that I recorded are listed in Figure 3.3.

4 Warner (1958: 23, 24) found this emphasis on the religious perceptions so consistent that in his
first field ttip he completely missed the fact that the Yoluu clearly understood the physiological
aspects of parentage.


                                                    87

              Each of these identifies a different stage of progress towards
independence and mobility.s This is a period of immaturity where the sex of an
individual is of minimal significance. In terms of stages of physical life or socially
recognised stages of life, both sexes are seen as passing from childhood, through
puberty to become unmarried adults, then wayamirr(home/place having), a parent for
the first time, a grandparent for the first time and as finally reaching old age and dying,
after which they will go to the place of the dead.

              Hypothetically these physical stages coincide with the stages of ritually
established religious seniority, referred to in the literature (e.g.Bemdt and Warner) as
age grading.

              THE "RELIGIOUS" LIFE CYCLE.

              The Yoluu religious outlook proposes that life exists prior to conception.
Ritually, it begins at conception and from conception on, the newly found human has
·entered childhood. The end of this childhood is marked differently for male and
female children and with that demarcation, differentiation begins in the use of
terminology to identify the successive developmental stages of the two sexes.

              For the male the end of childhood is marked by the dhapi (literally
foreskin) ceremony, during which the child is circumcised. Throughout the ceremony
he is known as me/ borum (lit. eye ripe) up until the cutting takes place. After the
operation, he is majan (circumcised) and the new term applied to him is gumnul
(young single male). At this stage he begins to learn self sufficiency and to become a
provider, and learns to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the older men that he is one
who keeps to the rom (the ways of his people). When this has been achieved, he will




S While these stages are all descrlptive phrases and are recognised as such, some of the terms are used
as thousdl they were classificatory s~es of development Tliroughout all these stages, and until the end
of childhood 1s reached at pubertY, the word applied to these young humans is, yothu/gunulk(child) or
djamarrkuJ.i (more than threechildien).


                                                88

be accepted as an initiate for the :oarra (sacred ritual ground and ceremony) and only

after this is he a Qimunu (man) and able to marry. In traditional or precontact terms,

until this ceremony had been performed all legal access to women was denied. In later

life he will be wonu.ou (an elder) and may become known as liya-:oiirramirr (lit. one

who thinks about the ceremonials), be a ceremonial leader, and in some cases,

equivalent to a magistrate who arbitrates and makes final decisions about disputes and

their settlement.


            For the female the end of childhood is traditionally marked by the

milif)girri ceremony at the onset of her first menses after which she is known by the

term wirr.kul_(single woman). I have not been informed of other ceremonially marked

life stages for women but a number of changes in the terms used refer to socially

observed stages of maturity. These are; wtl!Jamirr(literally, home-having) which

refers to any woman who has a husband and hence a home unit of her own, yothumirr

(literally, child having), that is a pregnant woman, and then gu:oman after she has

given birth to her first child. Two other stages described as being of real significance

to a woman are when she becomes miiri (M.M to a D.Ch) and miiri'mu (F.F.Z. to a

B.S.Ch.). As she becomes elderly, usually after at least one of the two grandmother

categories have been attained she will be known by the same term wonu.ou (elder), as

is applied to senior men. That, in brief outline, is the religious life cycle.


             Wamer(1937/58.130-31) says that,

             Age grading in Murngin [YolIJu] societies is highly ritualistic and controls
      a man's religious life far more than it does his ordinary daily existence..... The
      initiations elevate him from a lower and more profane existence to a higher and
      more sacred plane and mark his transition from one age grade to a higher and
      older one. Age grading then, controls the degree of sacred participation a man
      has within the community.


             In saying this he speaks as if the stages of progress are rigidly established

along a continuum. There is a continuous increase in a person's attainment of religious

knowledge and status; however while there are some clearly marked major steps that

can be taken, revelation appears to be as much a continuous process as a series of age

grades and nothing is quite as neat and tidy as Warner makes it sound. Having said

that, for the purpose of description I have identified some sections of the religious life

cycle and will examine them one at a time. These are: existence before conception, the

passage through physical life as a ritual progression, and death and the afterlife.

              EXISTENCE BEFORE HUMAN LIFE.

              As mentioned earlier the individual is understood to exist prior to

conception. Williams (1986:31) says that "Yolngu believe the spirits that animate

foetuses are always at, or come from, specific places, or both", and the notion of

existence in a location is widely agreed with throughout the literature. 6 However the

idea that it is a spirit that animates the foetus needs some clarification on two points.

Firstly there is a word birrimbirrwhich refers to a continuing aspect of a person after

death. This is commonly and inadequately translated as "spirit" or "soul", but I have

not heard this word used in association with pre-conception experiences.


              Traditionally it is of significance to the Yol:ou to have a recogniseable

external sign or experience by which a conception can be identified. However what is

described as coming is either the child (yothu), its image ( wuvuli or mall), sometimes

in English as the baby's spirit, or some transformation in form that is considered to be

the child. Secondly, it is described as coming to its father or mother or both but is not

described as coming to the baby (foetus), an impossibility considering that it is the

baby.7 This interpretation agrees with Shapiro (1979:9), and Warner ( 1937/58:132)

notes that,

              The Murngin baby comes from the totem well through a religious
       experience of the father, .... The father's mystical dream experience is a kind of
       rite of passage of the unborn and begins the child's socialisation.




6 For example Warner 1937/58, Berndt 1964/68, Peterson 1972 and Williams 1986
7 It is quite possible that this way of referring to a child coming was what initially pursuaded Warner
that the Yoluu were ignorant of physical conception.

             After collecting a number of stories concerning conception experiences I
attempted to clarify this issue during a recorded interview with Rrurrambu, one of the
leading Arnhem Land Christians. Part of this interview I include below. It begins with
my proposition and leads to some interesting explanations of the Yoliju
understandings of pre-conception existence. Also expressed are some clear
understandings of the transformations of the form of existence without change of
identity. With all the clarity of expression it also demonstrates that the edges of many
of the ideas are fuzzy or unbounded. For example, what comes to the father is not a
spirit, but is the child's image, the child's spirit, an animal or fish, all of which are
treated as synonymous.
             I .R. I have heard that the spirits of the children are there in the country in a
      special place before they come to the mother to be born. Is that the true story?
             Rr. Biiyvu (nothing/ not so), no such spirit in the land before birth.
             I .R. What is it that comes to the father?
             Rr. Yothu wuvuli !Juli malu'thun biipawala or to wiripuwalayoluuwala.
      (The child's wuvuli [image] will appear to the father or to another person). It
      isn't there, but it comes at conception or just before. The spirit of yothu (child)
      indicates to parent (either) or to someone else. Normally to father. Just an
      indication that baby is on the way.
             J.R. Where does it come from?
             Rr. Comes in many forms, maybe in form of animal or marine life. When
      someone gets something special like dugong or kingfish. Or father might get a
      bigger catch than everyone for the week. The mother will tell (her husband) that
      she is pregnant. When he or the other person looks back, he can say "Oh yes
      that was the significance of that".
             I .R. What about the idea of being alive before being born?
             Rr. There is a reference made by some people to water. You hear people
      say something like,"Ifarra gan nhinan !Jlitllil ga yurrnha nheny dhawal-guyavan,
      gapuvur yan. (I was here before you were born, when you were just in the
      water. I don't know if they mean that the younger one still existed in the water or
      whether they mean spirit I think they are referring to semen, because we call it
      gapu (water) and wiyika (liquid).
             J.R. Can you give me an example?
             Rr. Just before I was born my father went out and speared a very big
      dugong. The very next day, my mother started to feel that she was about to have
      me. (She hadn't become aware that she was pregnant before that). That doesn't
      give me a dugong spirit, but puts me into a category that claims all miyapunu.
      (All marine mammals plus sea turtles). I was in the area when my father speared
      the dugong. I was in the form of dugong in that area where people who claim
      the land, claim the whale totem.
             J.R. That says you were there before you came to your mother?
              Rr. Yep. But whale is too big for the area where father found me so I
      became a dugong. ..
             J.R. Are you dugong now?

                                                    Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.

            Rr. No. Wuymirri (whale). I became whale because that's the country
      where I introduced myself to my father. I can claim whale totem, and negotiate
      with any other people who claim whale totem in any other part of the country.
            J .R. What are you?
            Rr. I'm a person
            J.R. What were you before you were born? A person or what? a whale?
            Rr. I was still a person before I became an animal. It's a process just the
      same as you see in nature. Butterflies come from cocoon but also from
      caterpillar.
            J .R. They are different things or the same?
            Rr. They are the same.
            J.R. In what way?
            Rr. The process of changing from whatever it is to something else.
            J.R. What is it that's changing?
            Rr. It doesn't change what it is. It only changes form. It's still the
      caterpillar, it's still the butterfly. It changes, but its still the same thing, the same
      identity.

            In the harpooning of the dugong by Rrurrambu's father we see a good
example of what Warner (1958:23) calls an "extra-mundane experience" by which a
child indicates its presence and is recognised before conception. While Warner
suggests that this indication is always given to the father, and this appears to be
considered normal, there is not any total consistency and it may be the mother or
another member of the community who has such an .experience, or there may be no
experience at all. In the following excerpt from an interview with Mawunydjil there is
one example of a father's experience, one of a grandmother's dream, and a listing of
four out of six children of the one couple for whom there were no signs noted.
             M. If one of our children ask we will say they were bird, or fish, or turtle,
      or maypal (shellfish) or warrakan (animal)before they were born. Second is sign
      will happen for a man or a woman. They see the sign and then the woman will
      be pregnant. That's the ;glithili;gu (of the past) story.
             Nimanydja (Mawunydjil's wife) and I were in Darwin in 1974, and we
      went hunting for wallaby. We had two children at that stage. I saw a python
      there. I thought it was a tyre or wood at first. I threw a stone at it and it moved. I
      called Nimanydja and my sister and they saw it too. We stopped looking and
      talked and it disappeared, but we didn't go looking for it. In three or four weeks
      time Nimanydja found that she was pregnant, and we knew that that biipi
      (snake) was a sign of the baby coming. When the baby was born we gave her
      the name Banbaniwuy. Later the family said that's the meaning of python.
             J.R. Did anything happen like that with the others?
             M. 1st baby in Melbourne. Heard footsteps in the room and actually saw
      footprints on the wooden floor they were like wet footprints in that you could
      see them on the floor. For the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth ones there were no
      signs.
             There are othet;. signs that a woman is pregnant. There is the sign of the
      woman wanting to eat too much like maypal (shellfish). People will say to a
      woman like that, "Nhli nhe yothumirr'!' (What's this? Are you with child?) ·
      Sometimes there is the sign of vomiting a lot, and sometimes their face changes.

                  Nimanydja dreamed of finding a fat baby boy and of showing him to
           others in the dream. I thought a miracle was coming for me [because all the first
           six children are girls], but then our daughter told us she was pregnant. The baby
           she had was a boy and grew big.
                  In traditional thinking a baby comes from sea, wind, tree. It's just there,
           for a long time, some people believe that the baby is there now swimming in the
           sea with fish and turtles and stingrays. They are not those things. Don't know
           what they look like.
                  When I see a big turtle, I can spear it. The baby spirit, (not a turtle spirit)
           will come to me, and then when I kiss my wife, the spirit goes to her. Can see
           on a baby the birthmark where the turtle was speared.
                  I can believe these things because of my own experience. 8

                  Included in both Mawunydjil's and Rrurrambu's observations is the clear
     indication that the child is assumed to be existing somewhere before it comes to its
     mother. There is also demonstrated in Mawunydjil's comments an expectation that
     there is likely to be further proof of the baby's identity presented through some mark
     on its body, a mark that can be related to the treatment given to its "image", such as a
     birthmark which relates to where the image was speared.9 This expectation is also
     referred to in the story from Maratja recorded in the following chapter where Maratja
     refers to himself as having minimal body hair because the hair was scraped off the
     ·yam that was his conception indication.

                  As far as which parent contributes what to the conception of the child,
     Berndt (1964:121) says that,
                 "the father contributes the child's bone substance, the mother its blood and
           flesh. He then says that, "the bones are likened to sacred emblems of rangga"
                  11

           and that "these objects come down to a child in the paternal line just as his bone
           substance does    11
                                  •




                  This is not however the most accurate representation of the Yol:ou notion.
i    A Yo~u person uses the one word, "!]araka", for bones, for the sacred emblems (the

speaks of his wi4Ja varaka (literally place bone}, the site to which he is patrilineally
affiliated and which is part of his identity. As Peterson ( 1972= 17) says there is a
           link between a man, his bones, his animating spirit and his country
      [which] lies at the heart of men's sacred ritual.

             The Yo~u makes little discrimination between these different uses of the
term, for each is in an equivalence relation to the other and seen as simply a different
revelation or transformation of the one identity as discussed earlier.

             When this understanding is then applied to the first part of Bemdt's
statement (above), the information given can then be taken to mean that "the father
contributes the child's identity" which includes his bones, his ravga, and his spiritual
affiliation with land. That which is the foundation of his religious identity.

             THE HUMAN LIFE CYCLE.

             Usually well before puberty, and somewhere between eight and eleven
years of age (Williams 1982: 199) a boy is circumcised.

             Each circumcision ceremony is a unique event patterned according to the
identity and relationships of the individual that the ceremony will gumnulkuma (make
into a gumnul, or circumcised unmarried male) and of those conducting the ceremony.
In whatever form it occurs, the dhapi (foreskin) or circumcision ceremony marks the

first step of a male Yol:ou into the religious life as an individual. It is currently
possible that a man can live his entire life without making further progress in the
religious life for a variety of reasons. These may range from his personal behaviour
being unacceptable to the religious community to a choice as part of a Christian
lifestyle not to follow the traditional religion.

             Considering the normal traditional progress, Wamer(1958:125-137) lists
a number of rites of passage which mark the transfer from one level of age grading to
                             ..

totems, and death with its involvement in mortuary ceremonies of various kinds. The

first of these occurs before birth, and the last occurs after death.10,1ob.

The Djambarrpuy:gu clan describe the life cycle analogically using a myth about the

construction and use of a turtle harpoon rope in which the rope, constructed of spun

fibres, represents an individual and his/her identity made up of many interwoven

aspectsll. In Rudder (1980: 37-47) I recorded two versions of the myth (see

Appendixes C and D), both shared with me by Djorrpum. These were a narrative

version, and a song version, from which I extracted a structural analysis and sought to

demonstrate "the richness and depth of meaning of Yol:uu mythology". Most of the

following interpretations of the analogues came from Djorrpum, however discussions

 10 As Warner summarises, (ibid: 132) "The father's mystical dream experience is itself a kind of rite
of passage of the unborn and begins the child's socialization. The father's announcement to the
 mother of the child's arrival .... changes the father's age-grade status.... his first child's 'birth' effects
 the father's spiritual birth into a recognised higher status in the community age grouping, and
 simultaneously the new being is,, taken into the lowest age grade. As an old man, the Mumgin learns
 the final mysteries of life by seeing the most esoteric of the totems. Ultimately he dies and assumes
 a new social status, and by the mourning rite of passage enters his last social grouping".
 11 See also text quoted from Djangirrawuy in Chapter 2. In his discussion of ancestral power, where
 string/rope is equatedto marr {d.esires and feelings)            . ..                   .
lOb The structural analysis of this myth bears a clear relationship to Uvi-Strauss's analysis of the
Story of Asdiwal (1967:1-47) in that both analyses demonstrate that the different levels of
interpretation can be seen to have "an underlying logical structure common to all of them": and
that the comparison of different versions reveals information about each of them.

of the contents of that article with the YolIJu since it was published have revealed that

there is considerably more symbolism involved in the myth than was at first apparent.


             At the time I postulated the possibility of a level of symbolism which

referred to the creation of a sacred ra.uga (ritual object). This has now been confirmed

and as a level of meaning is outlined in Figures 3.7 and 3.8. Included in the levels of

meaning that have now been proposed to me are the following outlined in the set of

diagrams in Figures 3.4 to 3.6:

             a. the physical life stages of a man (Figure 3.5),
             b. the life stages of a woman (Figure 3.6),
             c. the stages of the creation of a raIJga (Figure 3.7 and 8), and
             d. the stages of a man's journey through life and then through death to the
point of entry into Burralku, the home of the dead (Figure 3.9).


             In addition to these "levels of meaning", there are as I will show,

variations and interpretations possible in an otherwise apparently fixed system. I

first take the narrative version of the myth, the more recently revealed meanings

of the analogue, and an expanded version of the structure of the symbolic

meanings to demonstrate some of the cosmological assumptions that are implicit

in the interpretations.

            Figure 3.5. The physical life cycle of a man.


             The narrative version as told by Djorrpum includes the information

associated with the transformation of the rope from one stage to the next, while the

contents of the song refer only to the successive states of existence. The song version

commenced with non-verbalised singing which corresponds (in terms of stages) with

the assumption that before Mukarr went gathering fibres to make the rope the fibres

were already there waiting to be gathered.


            In Figure 3.4, it can be seen that the eight sections of the song contents,

which represent the eight states through which the rope passes, can be seen as

analogues of eight recognised stages of a man's progress through life, or more

accurately, the sequence of states of existence he moves through during his

lifetime. The additional information supplied by the narrative version includes a

series of actions each of which is performed at the end of a stage. These can be

interpreted as analogical references to the ritual events which occur in a man's life, the

actions performed on the man (the rites of passage), which cause him to be

transformed from one religious state to the next. The set of states numbered in the

figures as five to eight are also perceived as being in an analogous relation to those

numbered one to four. Thus the set of eight static classifications can contract into a

doubled set of the four elements which then forms the basis of the analogical reference

framework. States 1 and 5 are
                           . in a particularly interesting analogous relationship to
each other. State 2 is a stage of existence as a child before being manifest as a child

through conception and state 5 is a stage of existence as a married person, the proof of
which, and the evidence of which are not manifest until the wife conceives. 12

             Each of the Figures 3.4 to 3.8. represents one of the separate
interpretations of the symbols in the above myth. Figure 3.5 is an alternative
representation of the symbolic interpretation listed in Figure 3.4, but as physical and
social man in contrast to the religious stages of man in Figure 3.4. Note that the rites
of transfer as shown in this interpretation and the ones that follow may be either
socially or ceremonially marked events.13

             The Figure 3.6, illustrates the interpretation of the myth in terms of a
woman's life cycle. In addition to this it also indicates how the interpretation of
analogous reference is able, as it were, to take on a life of its own, such that instead of
being interpreted as two layers of four to match the structure of the myth, a third level
of four stages was given by Yoq,u people. This third level is interpreted as yet another
level of truth contained in the analogue, and was given without any perception that it
was going beyond the structural content It was simply another analogous set. The

the discussion. Once the pattern is understood it is not difficult to see that it represents

             The interpretation of the myth as representing the construction of a I'a{Jga
 (ritual object) is outlined in Figure 3.7 where the basic elements of the interpretation
 are outlined and again in Figure 3.8, where additional aspects of the symbolism are
 examined. In order to give a better appreciation of the interpretation, it is of value to
 consider the normal processes of the construction of a ravga, the sequence of events,
 and the division oflabour.

             The first part of the production is concerned with the manufacture of the
 special varieties of string that are needed for construction work. String for ceremonial
 use is produced from the inner bark of manU!Junyu (Ficus virens) and gunumu (Ficus

sp. ?) trees. The initial work, from the gathering of the fibres to the production of the

raw string is considered to be women's work. As they spin it they roll it onto a core of

paper bark ready to hand to the men (with analogies here which relate to the formation

of the foetus within the womb and to the birth of a completed child, as in states 2 and

3 of Figures 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7). In the construction they use the decorative elements of

fur or feather that have been previously collected by the men (analogous to state 1)
and handed to them (analogous to the transfer from state 1 to state 2). 14


              The feathered or furred string at this stage is taken over by the men, who

store it for use in the construction of the desired ceremonial items, (the state of the

string then being analogous to state four in the figures). At this point, the foundational

work is finished, as it the women's work, and the men are ready to commence the

construction of the ra,uga itself. After the arrangements have been made for the

appropriate ceremonials a shade hut is contructed with supports formed from forked

sticks for the ra{}ga to be placed on, and material for the core collected (state 5 in the

figure). The ra{}ga itself is constructed inside the hut (as indicated in state 6) and is

normally based on a wooden or paperbark core. The hut here being an analogue of the

womb. The strings that have been taken from the women are used by the men for

wrappings or bindings over the core, and to make wana (arms) of feathered or furred

tassels using the correct design for the particular ra{}ga. The construction work is

carried out only by men of the appropriate ceremonial status and to the accompaniment

of the songs associated with the raIJga. On completion it rests on the forked stick

supports until the time comes for its emergence on the ceremonial ground. It has in the




14 Women make three different types of string for ceremonial, the type being dependent upon the
clan or moiety affiliation of the man for whom they are spinning it.
For the Yirritja moiety clans, bulka is made from possum's fur or from fibre with possum's fur spun
into iL The men hunt the possums, scrape the fur off the skin, and pass it on to the women for
spinning. Until relatively recent years, bulka was spun from the possum's fur only using the same
spindle technique as is used for spinning hair string. Now, because of shortage, the fur is either spun
into plant fibre string, or completely replaced by wool in a variety of colours, initially this substitute
was extracted from woollen gan:Jlents, but is now usually purchased in the local store. The Dhuwa
clans have two varieties of string into which feathers are spun. One group of clans collects the white
down feathers of water birds, splits the feathers down the mid rib thus forming raman, and passes on
the raman for the women to spin into plant fibre. The second group of clans collects the red breast
feathers from the rainbow lorrikeet. These are spun whole into the plant fibre to produce worrutj.

process of construction become a sacred object, a transformation of the represented

spiritual entity and is to be handled with great care by the right people.


            On the ceremonial ground the rarJga not only represents the presence of

the spiritual entity, it has become the manifestation of that entity, its actions are the

actions not of the man bearing it, but of the spiritual beings. The rehearsals are able to

be seen as analogous to the later years of life. The removal of the feathered or furred

strings from the nqJga, analogous to the removal of the turtle rope from the float and

harpoon barb in the myth is also analogous to the separation of life from its human

frame, the string being considered as analogous to the life force of a man, his inner

being and desires. The strings then continue in the men's possession while the core is

placed inside the earth or water. The deconstruction of the ra{Jga being analogous to

the end of the physical manifestation of the person, the spiritual being, and the turtle

harpoon rope, the final transformation from the physical form at death. Its identity

remains embodied in the feathered tassels, and forms an analogue of a man's

continuing existence after life in his human body ceases.

            Figure 3.9 shows the stages of a man's journey through life and then

through death to the point of entry into B urralku, the home of the dead. This particular

interpretation of the myth was a result of discussion with Rrurrambu of the earlier

analysis. It relates to a brief narrative from his mother, which is included in the later

section of this chapter associated with the journey to the place of life after death.
Whether this was a traditional interpretation of the myth or a story to which he applied
the structures of the analogue, I am not able to say, but if it is the latter, it would
illustrate the potential for personal interpretation that lies in the structures.

             If the interpretation of the myth as the creation of a ravga is represented in

a spiral diagram (see Figure 3.8), additional aspects of analogical interpretations
become apparent. Each of the quadrants relates to one of the four states that are under
discussion. In the lower right quadrant (states 2 and 6), the female /processing
/commencement principle is dominant. In the myth this is indicated first by the forked
stick, and the connection of the elements to it, then by the canoe, and the turtle in it as
an analogue of the conceived child within the womb as the foetus forms. This is
clearly reflected in the two levels of interpretation, one as the man's life cycle, and the
other as the woman's. In the cycle of the ravga, it is represented by the women being
given the task of preparing the raw materials and turning them into a composite
product. In the outer section of the spiral this is analogous to both the hut as a symbol
of the womb, and the forked sticks upon which the rauga rests, as the woman's body.
It is here, within the "womb" that the ravga grows from a combination of elements
into an entity with body and arms and frequently other anthropomorphic features.

             The upper left quadrant (states 4 and 8) is one in which the male
/completion /fulfillment principle is dominant. Here the symbolism of the myth
focuses in the first level upon the connection of the rope/string (symbol of life and
religious identity) to the physical body (the float) and to the sexual maturity symbol,
the spear. Having passed through transformation into this state it is one of completion
and of readiness to engage in the full activities of life. For the man this represents the
passing through circumcision and entry into ritually recognised masculinity. For the
woman also transfer to this section represents the passage of the rites associated with
                              ,.
the onset of her menses with the ritual entry into womanhood, and one can postulate



                                            102

 that the "dominance of the male" principal is relevant though it was not overtly stated.
 For the ravga it marks the completed and sacred materials in the men's control. The
 transfer of the string to the men is a conscious symbolising of the mythical action of
 men in the myth of the Djag'kawu (creative beings) stealing the sacred items from the
 two sisters who were originally in control of them (as outlined briefly in Chapter 2).

              In the outer section of this fourth quadrant, the same male- completion-
 fulfillment principle is reflected. In the myth the rope has just been disconnected from
 the harpoon and float. Having completed the task for which it came into being, it lies
 at the mercy of wind and tide to unwind its elements and scatter them. For the man
 and the woman both, this state represents the time when the final mysteries are
revealed as death approaches and the man hands on his ritual authority to his chosen
 successor. It is a state of complete dependence upon other males to carry out the
 appropriate rites at its completion which will transfer him to the next state. Life is
 complete, the task of raising children is over, human sexuality is of no relevance. In
· the symbolism representing the ravga, there is similarly a state of completion for at
 this point, is the final revelation of the ravga to the new initiates.

              The upper right and lower left quadrants (states 1 and 3 respectively)
represent asexual states. Though the two states appear to be under the external
 dominance of male and female respectively, for the individual subject these remain
 states of inactivity.

              In state l, in the myth and again in the ravga symbolism, there is the clear
recognition that the elements to be used are already in existence. However there is a
 contrast between the two. In the myth, the spirit beings (which are not distinguished in
 terms of sex), collect all the elements; whereas in the preparation for making the
 ceremonial string, there is a division of labour. While the women collect the physical
 substance, that is, the basic.frame work, it is the men who collect the feather and fur
 the patterns of which represents the identity that is to be woven into it. The symbolism


                                             103
                                                         Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.


of State 1, in the male and female life cycles, indicates that the raw elements, the
unidentified children are in a state of pre-existence, waiting to announce their presence
and identity in ways such as I have already described and to combine in the woman's
body to form a foetus. Again it is considered normal for it to be the man who has
some experience which can be paralleled to the idea of gathering the identifying
(inside) elements, while the woman's part is that of the physical (outside) elements. In
state 5 there is as mentioned earlier a similar idea of marriage in existence, but not yet
evidenced

              The third state, while a state of inactivity, is at all levels a period of growth
and preparation for the "real" activity of the fourth state, a preparation for transfer to
the men's world. In the myth, and in the construction of the rariga, the rope is rope and
while it does not change from being that, it is perceived as growing to the correct size,
or of going through the process of becoming a more complete expression of its nature.
Similarly in the human cycles the child while remaining a child "ripens" to the point of
completion of childhood. The rope is seen to be piling up on the ground on the other
side of the forked stick in the same way as the string is spun on, and the new born
infant comes from between the woman's thighs onto the ground.

              At all levels of symbolism and in all quadrants of the diagram lies one of
the major foundations of what I have previously called "qualitative thinking" (Rudder
1983). This concerns the nature of equality. In Western thought the dominant
consideration in the evaluation of equality is associated with quantitative measurement
of any quality~However, in qualitative thinking (In Levi-Bruhl's earlier writings, "pre-
logical"), that which is analogous is considered to be equivalent. This same notion is
the foundation of the structure of symbolic reference which functions through the use
of analogue.15 For the person whose thought is based in qualitative logic, that which

                                .
lSa Here I refer to the dominant though not the only consideration and to everyday practice in the
present W estem wodd.

15 It is also the basis of the thought behind sorcery and sympathetic magic.

is analogous to something else is "just the same" as it or equivalent to it. For the

Yo]-Ou, for whom this is the normal thought style, the layering of analogous reference,

that I have been describing in association with the myth of the turtle harpoon rope, is

is not a situation of one item being representative of the other, but two sides of one

truth being expressed. In a way which connects to the earlier described

understandings of the relations between whole and part, each is not a symbol of the

other, as considered in western thought, but each is considered as a different

manifestation of the other, so that the two are in essence, "just the same".

            LIFE AFfER DEATH.

            It cannot be assumed that there is a single corporately agreed upon body

of knowledge about death and dying held by all the members of any group, although

there may be groups of corporately "agreed upon" assumptions. YolIJu society is no

exception to this. I attempted on a number of occasions to find the YolIJu "corporately

held truth about the nature of man", particularly with regard to the understandings of

life after death, and the question of what happens after a man dies. At a superficial

level, the answers I was given did not appear to present a single understanding of the

cosmos or of man's place in it. I was presented with a wide range of answers to

questions about life after death and an equally wide range to inquiries about death,

dying and funerals and the associated practices. As the concepts involved in these

answers were examined and discussed with the YolIJu a second level of

understanding linked to cosmological presuppositions became apparent. In this second

level I found a high (though not universal) level of agreement, and I will consider that

aspect later.


            Some of the answers I was given have already been recorded by others

and will not be extensively duplicated here. The procedure I follow here is to examine

first the range of information I was given about the after death existence of the

individual and then consider some of the practices associated with death and dying




                                              105

that have been discussed in the literature, and which I have observed at a number of

funerals. With these will be linked the interpretations of meanings as shared by a

range of people which includes confirmed traditionalists, some committed Christians

and some who assume to be both. A distinction between corporately held beliefs,
which "everyone knows" and individual or small group beliefs, which "no-one else

knows" is relevant here. Throughout this section the concepts discussed earlier in the

chapter concerning whole and part, life and living, and transformation are of

significant importance.


            Vlhere do the dead go?

            I have not discovered a myth which can unambiguously be interpreted as

depicting the ~rigin of death, however there are myths about death, the afterlife and of

journeys from the place of dying to a place of some kind that is reached after death,

and death appears to be treated as a normal expectation as part of the passage through

life. In practice, death with its associated ceremonial appears to have been elevated to

the most important of all rites of passage. The certainty of the existence of the afterlife

and some details of its nature are verified in the myth of the jouney of a man named

Yawuluura to Burralku. Burralku is also spoken of in both the Djau'kawu and the

Morning Star myths as being an island to the east of Arnhem Land where the

deceased Dhuwa clansmen are involved in dancing every night. Versions of the

Yawuluura myth have been recorded by Warner (1958: 524-528), Thornell (1986:62)

Berndt and Berndt (1988:378) and myself (see Appendix B). The myth tells how the

man (who has several names) made a canoe journey to Burralku, met the spirits of the

deceased, returned to his family and then died and went back to Burralku. The version

of the myth recorded in the appendix was told to me by Mathaman Marika at Yirrkala

in 1967.

            When Mathaman's story is compared with other published versions

certain facts concerning the afterlife are seen to be presented.




                                               106
                                                       Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.

            a. The Dhuwa moiety dead go to an island to the East.
            b.It is to a place called Burralku.
            c. It is a place like "here'.
            d. The normal Yoiuu activities are carried out there. A man hunts the same
animals and enjoys copulation, singing and dancing. Woman apparently caries out all
her normal roles, except that neither in this story nor in any other have I heard
reference to childbearing at Burralku.16

             As far as a Yirritja moiety land of the dead is concerned, Morphy
(1984.41) gives the name Milnguya [MilIJuya] recording that
            In the case of Milnguya ...... the souls go to a place where a length of
      possum fur string stretches up to the sky. The souls climb up the string until
      they reach the Milky Way, where the spirits can be seen as shining stars17

             From his description, this place is at least relevant to the MaI]galili clan
whose land is centred on Djarrakpi. The Warramiri clan from Dholtji, further to the
north (also Yirritja), speak of a place called Batu (somewhere near Thursday Island)
presumably reached by canoe. I was told about it by a Christian woman who
contrasted it with Burralku, saying that,
             Burralku is the place for Dhuwa, and Batu is the place for Yirritja. At
      Burralku food is galun (a yam) and at Batu the food is berratha/Janydjarrva
      (rice). We don't know where it is but we know that when we die that birrimbirr
      goes there. Not married there, just go there and eat -0atha (vegetable food).

             These stories give the suggestion that there are conflicting models of the
place of the afterlife, however Morphy ( 1984:41) suggests that,
             models Yolngu have are not alternative models, but complementary ones,
      and they combine with individual theories and speculations on the nature of an
      afterlife. They provide guidance for individual introspection on the nature of
      death, and provide focal images that structure collective action aimed at ensuring
      that the spiritual component of man should reach its destination, or achieve its
      final state, whatever that state should be.
              And again (p40-1)




16 There are however unresolve9 issues in the story. This is the place for Dhuwa moiety dead,
therefore by implication the Yirritja dead must go somewhere else, so there must be another place for
them. Secondly, as this is the place for Dhuwa moiety dead, and intra-moiety sex is forbidden, there
is an implication that normal rules of sexual behaviour do not apply.
17 In this case Morphy is using "soul" to translate the Yolgu word, "Birrimbirr".

                                                   107

               the Yolngu do not have a simple concept of the soul, nor do they have a
        single model of what happens to the spiritual component of people after their
        death. Rather a series of models exist which reflect different possible states of
        spiritual existence which are related to different forces in the universe and
        different emotions felt by the bereaved. Some models include fairly concrete
        images of a life after death that resemble closely life on earth.

              A Yo~u man is quoted by Morphy as arguing that the Yoluu have "two
main theories of what happens to the spirit, one of which is influenced by
Christianity". There definitely has been a real influence from Christianity, but the
Yoluu have more than two different theories or models. I have discovered several
different traditional models as well as a Christian one and I will consider them one at a
time.

              First there is the "place of the dead" model outlined above with its
minimum of three different ideas of location. Complementary to this is the model that
proposes that the dead go to the homeland centre (Yirralka) to which their clan is
linked. It is this model to which the current funeral ceremonies seem to be most
. closelyrelated.18 Each clan has its own Yirralka and some have more than one, so that
this model for the place of the deceased has as many destinations as there are
Homeland Centres in Arnhem Land.

              A slightly different model has the deceased going back to join the clan's
sacred identity (the magayin) and a distinction was made between this identity and the
homeland centre where the sacred identity is perceived to exist. As one man said,
''When I die I go back to the magayin." I asked him if this meant the magayin place
(the Yirralka) but his emphatic reply was ,"No, the majayin itself'. Wamer (1958:25)
incorporates these two as a single destination which he names, "the sacred narra well".
In terms of geographic location there would appear to be good grounds for this as the




18 Morp!ly describes in detail one funeral based on this model1 showing how the function of the funeral
is to gwde the ~n's birrimbinon its journey to "its spiritwu resting pJace in the clan land of the
deceased" (p.47).

maflayin is considered to be within the Yirralka. However as the Yoliju man

interpreted this there is a definite difference made between the two.

            The series of Yoliju models that Morphy refers to are not however limited
to the notions of a set of places for the dead. These places to which the dead travel
form one type of model. In addition to these ideas there is another fairly commonly
held notion which overlaps with thoughts expressed about the way a child announces
its coming prior to conception. In this set of ideas the no longer physical person can
become united at least temporarily with an animal or even a plant and cause a change
in it which is recognisable. Nevertheless the pragmatic side of the Yoliju approach is
also likely to come to the fore and the animal will be also recognised as edible though
different as Galpagalpa said,
            Old time when Yoliju dh4Jgam [person dies], (miri!Ju [enemy] kill him)
      nhan!Ju birrimbirrgarrtjamballil (his spirit enters a kangaroo).
            Jjayi dhu [It will become] maluutj (kangaroo with yoliju mali [image I
      reflection/ shadow] in it) ma.1.ginarama(find) mal!Jutjthu..
             "Sometimes Yolgu will ask" Garrtjambal yuwalk? !Jula nhii?"[Is this
      really kangaroo or what?] Mal!Jutj is very fat and tastes different, like Yoliju
      !Janak [Human flesh]. Him giJrrtjambal [kangaroo] all right but taste different."


            Or it may be as Yotjiu described,
            I heard a story that if a Yoliju dies, he transforms into something like a
      buffalo. Maybe he comes close to people because he is a transformation of a
      deceased relative and they feed it and let it go. The spirit goes into the animal
      and leads him where to go, makes him bajiny (peaceful I quiet) and leads him
      where his relation is. It is normally a dangerous warrakan (animal). Jjuli mari
      djiima mar.ogi !Junhi ordinary warrakan. (If it makes trouble, you know its just
      an ordinary animal).

            In both the above explanations there is the idea that in some way, the
person after death, either enters an animal and this brings about a recognisable change
in it, or transforms into an animal. In Galpagalpa's example the difference appears to
be identified in the flesh of the animal after it has been killed. In Yotjiu's story a

transformation is perceived in the personality of the animal. This latter type appears to
be the more common, and! have been told of kangaroos, wallabies and emus that




                                           109

have come right into a camp and accepted food from people's hands, showing none of
the normal fear of humans.

               An animal exhibiting such changed behaviour can be considered to be a
deceased person trying to communicate a message and the change in behaviour can
lead to a wide variety of interpretations. For example the interpretations could range
from good news such as, "Fred's brother has come to let us know that he is happy", if
Fred's brother has recently died, to such possibly bad news as "This might be my
uncle come to let us know that an enemy has speared him".

               A third different kind ofmodel spoken of occasionally is that after a
person has died he leaves his body and stays in the vicinity .19 This links to the idea
mentioned above of the need, after a death, to guide the deceased person to their
homeland centre. There appears to be a relationship between this and mourning
behaviour in that the Yoliju are all aware that they don't treat everyone as that person
would like. As a result, when a death occurs there is the need to express remorse
adequate to appease the deceased and their clan, and the need to perform all the rituals
for them adequately. There is also the possibility that if this is not achieved, the
deceased may stay around and work out their revenge. There is a practice carried out
by some, of calling out to the disembodied person after a death, to indicate if they are
still nearby by hitting on a tree or something in the camp.

               A somewhat different model of what happens after death has come out of
the influence of Christianity. Different in the sense of a non-traditional location, but
analogous to the first two Yoliju solutions in that it proposes an after death existence




19 There appears to be a relationship between this idea and the anomalous state of the mo.lcuy(dead
one/spirit being). There are also ~ssible links to the notions of mokuys as having malevolent
charaCteristics, and these being linked further to ideas of need for more care in c:tealing with funerals of
what could be called more malevolent people.

at a place. This was neatly encapsulated by Rrurrambu in an inteiview situation as

follows;

             Rrurrambu. When I die I don't know what my spirit is going to be (that is,
      the form it will take), but they will have the ceremonial bUi)gul (dance) over my
      dead body, and those totems will be placed on my body or on my box.
      Everything will be centred on those two creatures. (Whale and dugong).
             J .R. What is going to happen to it?
             Rrurrambu. There is one way of saying it. [The one just described]. The
      truth is .. , you want the truth? All I know is that my spirit will be with God. My
      spirit will shine with the greatness of his glory.
             J.R. Where will you be?
             Rrurrambu .. I will be with God.
             J.R. If you had grown up without Christianity what would your answer
      be?
             Rrurrambu .. I would go back to the sea, because the people claim that's
      what I am during my lifetime.
             J.R. Back to the same place?
             Rrurrambu .. Yep. That's the old philosophy without Christianity.


            Not all the YolIJu follow Rrurrambu's clear distinction between the

traditional answers and a Christian one. It is in this situation that the significance of

the equivalence between analogous relations and between whole and part again

becomes apparent. One woman, a member of a strongly traditional Yirritja clan

married to a ceremonial leader from a small Dhuwa clan, was asked what would

happen to her when she died. Her answer was so exquisite that on a later occasion

when it was appropriate I asked her the same question and received the same answer

she had been quoted as giving.

            One half of me goes to my homeland and one half goes to that island out
      there [to the east] and the other half of me goes to heaven [indicating the
      Christian's heaven].


            There was no indication in her answer that there was a problem of any

kind in it There is the potential for her answer to be interpreted in such a way as to

suggest that she is considering herself to be some sort of composite, but the

understanding of equivalence between whole and part, combined with the analogous

relation between the three locations causing them to also be considered as equivalent

explains this. One periodically hears the comment that the Yirralka (the central focus

of a homeland area) is "just the same as" heaven, so there appears to be no difficulty

in assuming that two separate places are different manifestations or understandings of
the same place. As for example one of the younger Dhuwa ceremonial leaders said to
me that,
           Morning Star starts at Burralku. Burralku means like place of birth and
      heaven and place where someone dies, they go back there.

            That is, the name "Burralku" can be considered as equivalent to "the place
of the afterlife", or "the place of pre-conception existence", or any such place. Another
example comes from Mawunydjil, who, when asked where he would go after death,
replied,
            I will go to my homeland, Lu:ogutja. There is also a Yirritja wiija called
      Yirralka. That's where the spirit goes. If I look at it as a Christian, Yirralka
      means heaven.

            On his interpretation it is possible to propose that Heaven and Yirralka
"are just the same" in a Yol:ou qualitative sense. From this perspective it is possible to
consider that multiple places are multiple manifestations of a single reality and that
there is no difficulty for the YoI:ou to incorporate changes while maintaining that that
which is incorporated is not new. Bos (1988.392,3) has advanced the idea that the
Yol:ou follow a proposition that, "All those things which are accepted as true have
always been [in existence]. Then it follows that if xis to be accepted as true, then x
has always been." and that this proposition accounts for "the readiness with which
'new' phenomena are incorporated into The Dreaming".

            I did not find evidence which conflicted with this. It is however my
assertion that it is the perception of equivalence in analogues which provides the
mechanism for such propositions to function effectively, for the Yol:ou to hold
"different" solutions concurrently, and for these to be considered as not different, but
"just the same". There is no difficulty in considering several places to be equivalent, or
several different parts of a person or object to be equivalent, and if they are equivalent
they are "just the same". So while there appear to be a diversity of answers to the

 question of ''Where do the dead go?", these can be reduced to the following four
 propositions.

                a. There is an afterlife at a place to which one goes after death.
                b. Christians go to heaven, Yol:uu to Burralku, so Christian YoI:uu go to
 both.
                c. When the person leaves their body, they may not go straight to that
 place.
                d Therefore there may be communication between them and the living.

                When these propositions are considered together, they can be asserted to
 be simply different aspects of a single theme and complementary rather than
 conflicting. Another way of saying this is that all the various interpretations are
 analogues of each other. Each reflects the presupposition that identity continues after
 death and as a result each indicates that there is a place where that continuation occurs.
 Any new truth which can be considered as analogous to them can then be considered
 as just the same as them and therefore part of or a different revelation of the same
· known truths.

             The Journey to the place of the Life after Death

             In addition to the apparently conflicting ideas of the location of the
 afterlife, there are a range of ideas about the journey to that place. Morphy's ( 1984)
 monograph is a carefully outlined analysis of one such journey worked out through
 the process of funeral arrangements. The Burralku in this narrative is described as
 being a very long canoe journey in an easterly direction, and also as the place of origin
 of the morning star. The story has strong similarities both to the earlier quoted story of
 Yawul:uura, and the exposition by Morphy of the function of funeral arrangements.

                An entirely different understanding of the passage to Burralku is

 contained in a brief story told to Rrurrambu by his mother before she died (see earlier
 Figure 3.9).



                                            113
                                                       Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.



             After a man dies, he just goes on walking. Then he comes to a place that is
      hilly. At that place another spirit sees him there and spears him. The spirits spear
      him in the elbow and the leg. Up until then he had been crawling, but spearing
      his elbows makes them strong, spearing his legs makes them strong and then he
      can walk on with them. He is in Burralku.


             Here again is Burralku as the destination of the deceased person, but this

time it is on land and can be reached on foot. There is no sea and no island. If we ask

the question, "What is Burralku?", it would appear to be conceptualised, at minimum,

as a place which is the destination of the deceased. It can be described in terms that

make it sound like a geographic location, but has other qualities that indicate that it

belongs to a place of a different kind. Some versions of the Djau'kawu myth record

Burralku as their place of origin, others have the Djau'kawu coming from a place still

further east and visiting Burralku on the way to their landing on the eastern coast of

Arnhem Land. We are left with the question, "Where is Burralku?"20 The most

accurate answer that appears to be possible is one that leaves it open ended in the way

that the Yoluu do and say that Burralku is simply a general term for the place where

the Dhuwa dead go, what it means is open for interpretation.


             The Nature of the Afterlife.

             The two brief versions of the journey to the place of the afterlife, while

they contributed no details of life at the place at the end of the journey, did present

several different aspects of the afterlife human being. I have deliberately avoided use

of the term spirit as being inadequate to equate to the Yoluu terms. The Yoluu when

speaking in English often use the words spirit and soul alongside Yoluu terms as I

have mentioned earlier, but there is no consistency in the ways different Yoluu use the

English terms. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any consistency either in the

translation of the Yoluu words into English by previous writers. Judging from the



20 There are also a number of p'ces around the Arnhem Land coast that are called Burralku and at
least one of these is said to have been visited by the Morning Star in its travels. There may well be
no connection between these places and the place to which the dead travel, but the potential to make
connections is there.

context of their use of English there is often no way to isolate which YolIJu words are

referred to.


               There are three different attributes commonly isolated by terms for the

after death human being used in Y olIJu language. Each of these has a range of

meaning and each overlaps to a certain extent the domain of meanings of the others.

First there is what is referred to as wu.vuli or maJi'21. This is the common word used

for a person's shadow,~ photograph, a representational drawing, or picture of any

kind.22


               Secondly there is the mokuy. Commonly this word (as described in

Chapter 2) is used to refer to both a corpse and to a recently dead person, these two

aspects of a person being considered as different. In Djiniyini's story of the journey to

Burralku (see Appendix E), mokuy is the name given to the dead people who inhabit

Burralku. It is also the general term used for a whole series of disembodied "spirits"

known to live in different locations, usually with clan affiliations and related myths,

song cycles and dances. Often they are described as having exaggerated genitalia and

abnormal sexual behaviour, and irrespective of whether these latter features are

relevant or not, they may be both celebrated and feared.


               One of the Christians said that the Christians have changed their

understandings here. When asked about the meaning of mokuy in relation to dead

body and spirit of the dead person he replied that,

            The Christian perspective is that people can say that he's not mokuynow,
      he's only a body. Don't call him mokuy again, he's just died. His body is there.
      The Christians believe a man just dies and his spirit leaves. He's not a mokuy
      anymre.
            "He dies human and his body is only like ashes (they say ashes to ashes
      and dust to dust), and his spirit will be like the second life. If we live we belong




21 Warner (1958:445) uses a third word for shadow, "warraw" (his warro) which he treats as an
alternative for and having the same meaning as birrimbirr.
22 According to one informant it is also the word he would use for the "spirit" of a dog.


                                                   115
                                                  Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.


      to Jesus, and if we die we belong to Jesus. That's Jesus' decision whether we're
      his or not.


            The third term "birrimbirt' (or mirritjal) appears in general use to be

associated with the after-death form of the complete person, with the idea that this

includes identity and personality. If we follow the details from Djiniyini's story, the

binimbirralso has the same appearance as the individual with the same ritual

markings such as a pierced nose and missing teeth.


            These are the generally accepted understandings of the three terms as I

have encountered them. It would be nice if it was possible to say that these can be

accepted with the precision of definitions, but their use is not as consistent as that. As

I have suggested above at the edges of their domains of meaning they overlap and at

the overlap either term can be used. The attributes being referred to in their use can

then only be clearly understood in context. Each one of them is regularly used in the

sense that the other is defined and one may be defined in terms of the other. For

example, a mokuy may be defined as a "Yiitjkurru (bad) birrimbirr". So while there

appear to be three separate attributes of the afterlife human with the appearance at

times that these are separate entities, and while there are three separate terms used, the

meaning of the terms can only be understood clearly in context.


            Processing the Dead

            There are three extensive accounts of the YolIJu approach to the

processing of the dead, each of which also includes various degrees of the YolIJu

understandings of these activities. Warner(1937/58:417-438) and Thomson (Peterson

1976b:97-108) recorded their observations at the time when the YolIJu had just begun

to live in settled communities along the Arnhem Land coast (1926-29 and 1935-43

respectively), a time when there appears to have been little change in the traditional

process. Morphy (1984) and Dunlop (1984) recorded their observations in the mid

1970s, showing that in the intervening period there had been some changes made in

the processing techniques. They note adaptations being made in the forms of


                                              116
                                                        Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.

processing, transformations of some processes, and the development of new phases
of ritual to meet changes in circumstances. As Morphy says (1984:44),
            The system is and probably always has been a dynamic one, and new
       elements continue to be incorporated within ceremonial performances which
       themselves are adjusting to changing circumstances.

              Both Warner and Thomson describe a second major stage of the
processing which involved exhumation and cleaning of the bones of the deceased.
These were then stored in a container and remained with the family for an unspecified
period. Morphy (1984:43) notes that this processing of the bones had not been done
recently at Yirrkala, but that a different second ceremony to process the deceased's
possessions is now carried out. He suggests that this may be analogous to the
cleansing of the bones. Dunlop (1989) suggests that these possessions are in fact
symbolically the bones being processed. 23

              In the earlier accounts it is also noted (eg Peterson 1976b:99) that a death
could involve the abandonment of a camp immediately after primary burial. Morphy
records (1984:44) that during his time at Yirrkala a house would be "abandoned for a
period of six months or so", and that this would then be followed by a purification
ceremony. In the latter part of the eighties, it has become common that a death occurs
outside of a house, often in hospital where the seriously ill are often taken, sometimes
in a cool open air shade built specially for a dying person's comfort. So there is a
sense in these cases in which the house where the person lived is less "polluted" by
their death. However even where a death is sudden, unexpected and inside a house it
is no longer uncommon at Galiwinku for the rest of the family to remain continually in
residence in the house. This may in fact be continued while the body also remains in
the house for the period of the ceremonies. 24



23 This retention of and processing of possessions is a continuing practice with the Yoli;iu at
Galiwinku, and with the current investments in large or expensive items such as cars, boats, videos,
                                more
T.V.s and furniture, there is far    to be processed
24niomson notes (Peterson 1976b:99) that the body was interred either the same day or the next
day. Currently the body, now regularly sealed in a special plastic bag lying in state in a coffin, may
remain in the camp at Elcho for ceremonies that last a week or more, and at Yirrkala where there are


                                                     117

              The concentrations of population in the larger centres has led to a
corresponding increase in the number of deaths in a single community in any one
year.25 With the increase in the length of mortuary rituals there can now be months at
a time when, depending on the distribution of deaths throughout the year, there can be
a continuous succession of funerals.

              This succession of funerals is regularly managed by having bodies held in
the morgues at Darwin or Gove until a community is ready to arrange the next funeral.
(see also Morphy 1984:45). Aerial transport between towns means that ritual leaders
no longer have distance as an excuse for non-attendance and the relatedness between
groups at the different centres puts strong pressure on them to attend. As a result they
can be expected to attend funerals for any of the important people in adjacent towns
and the funerals of all relatives. Thus ritual leaders can sometimes spend months at a
time in attendance at a succession of funerals. One of the responses that ritual leaders

who are not closest kin have taken to this has been to arrange for their arrival to
coincide with the final part of the ceremonies or on the day when the burial is expected
to occur. The implication communicated by this practice is that they are very busy and
hence important people, and that they have made an interruption to their other activities
because of their concern for the deceased and the families involved.

              Warner (1958:417-438) describes a series of processes which are applied
to the corpse and to those people and things that in various ways are connected to the

deceased. For example; affinal and cognatic kin, those who handle the corpse, or its
remains, those who are responsible to process it, and the possessions of the deceased.
The processes he describes can be listed as follows;




in the camJ> at Elcho for ceremoaies that last a week or more, and at YiITkala where there are now
refrigera!OO facilities in the camp for the coffin, it may remain in the camp for several weeks of
ceremorues.
25 For example Galiwinku has recorded an average of twelve deaths a year for the last fifteen years and
ten deaths a year for the preceding fourteen years.


                                                118
                                                          Chapter 3 - The Passage Through Life.



              a. painting the corpse,
              b. burial of the corpse,
              c. directing the deceased to another place,
              d. destruction of, or distribution of the deceased's possessions,
              e. cleansing I purifying those in contact with the deceased,
              f. cleansing I purifying the place of death.

              These were then followed at later times by;

              g. the cleansing and care of the bones from the rotting corpse, and
              h. the final disposal of the bones in a hollow log burial pole.26

              Morphy (1984:42) notes that prior to European contact the processing
could be considered as occurring in three phases, each of which were times of major
ceremony. These were primary burial (which included processes "a" to "f' in the
above list from Warner), secondary burial (process "g") and final burial (Process "h").
He makes the observation that while these three phases could still be identified at
Yirrkala in the 1970s, the emphasis was shifting towards primary burial.

              At Galiwinku, primary burial has become the ceremony to which the
largest numbers of people are drawn and as noted in the earlier records, the more
ritually important the deceased person is, the more groups attend and the more
elaborate the rituals. Secondary burial (Morphy's 'rag' ceremony) is not now a major
affair, and I know of only one hollow log burial pole erected at Galiwinku in the last
ten years.

              Each primary burial ceremony is, as Morphy has noted, a unique
composition consisting of elements which relate to the clan of the deceased, and to the
clans of those other kin attending.27 The function of the ceremonial is still to carry out



26 It can be said that the tools used in the various corpse-treating processes incl~; song, rhythm,
music and dance, fire, water and1)aint, and sculptures ranging from sculptured eann, thrOugli soft
sculptures of a wide variety, to decorated wooden objects and hunting weapons.
27 Morphy's (1984:47) summ~ of the function of the more ritual elements is that the ceremony is
concerned with "the joume)' of the binimbirr soul from the place of death to its spiritual resting place in
the clan land of the deceased".


                                                  119

the same processes as listed above as "a" to "f'', working a transformation on both the
deceased and the community. In doing this "the same" tools used in the past, or
equivalent versions of them are used to work the transformations.28

             In evaluating the function of the various aspects of the rituals it is
important again to remember the equivalence nature of analogues in Yo4Ju thought.
The song cycles, dances and other ritual objects and forms which present analogues of
the journey undertaken by the deceased person are for at least some of the Yoluu, not
simply symbolic of what is believed to be occurring. They by their presentation can be
considered to be creating, co-operating with, or presenting what is happening
simultaneously to the deceased so that the performers are not just symbolically
involved, but actually involved. As the coffin is moved and the songs and dances
present the coffin as a boat (or log) transporting the person, this is not simply a
symbol, but a sympathetic portrayal of what is actually happening to the deceased as
that person is being conveyed along river courses or tidal currents towards their
homelandcentre.

             In 1988 a 44 year old Wangurri man died in Darwin hospital after a short
illness. At Galiwinku there was a brief announcement ceremony where his identity
was communicated to the people through the dancing of ritual elements which
represented his identity and the calling of ritual names by which he could be identified
without speaking his ordinary name. The men then began to sing for him and to
prepare for the arrival by plane of a coffin bearing his body. The coffin was a named
boat as coffins are considered to be, and the plane carrying it was a transformation of
that boat. The coffin was met at the airstrip on the following Monday by members of
the deceased's mother's mother's clan with a four wheel drive vehicle. Some of this




28 Common statements given by the YoJuu concerning the function of funerals refers to such ~ts
as, "making everyone happy", or "saying goodbye" or "showing the family we care about them • Such
statements as these could 6e summansed as referring to the affirmation of relationships with those
bereaved.

escort carried flags on poles three to four metres long. The coffin was danced with the

movements of water from the plane to the vehicle which was now a boat to carry the

deceased. The escort formed up in front of and behind the vehicle, becoming a boat as

they did so, with the flag poles forming the mast as this transformation of the boat

carried the man on a journey through the town for one last look at it (Map 3.2). This

journey was arranged so that it culminated at his brother's house where both an open

shade and an enclosed shade (housing some ceremonial objects) had been built ready

to receive him. On arrival, the coffin, still as a boat was floated from the vehicle in the

arms of men dancing moving waters which transported the deceased to the open shade

where he was allowed to rest for a while on a new mattress with new sheets.


            Groups arrived to pay their respects. Men after dancing along the road up

to the sanded area between the shades (see Map 3.1) remained silent while the women

who had accompanied them wailed loudly and in each group some women attempted

to injure their heads with rocks or knives to demonstrate their grief. As one man

described it to me, they were attempting to show the deceased person that they really

did care, but that they were guilty for not having shown him adequate care, and now

they were showing how sorry they really were for their failures towards him.


            Later after all the different groups had paid their respects, and at six thirty

as sunset was approaching, the water currents were again danced to move the coffin

from the open shade to the closed shade (Plate 3.1 ). This was a restricted place for

men only, where the sacred objects would keep him company, till the final journey to

church and grave the following Sunday afternoon. I was not privy to the activities

inside.


            There is an equivalence relation between the closed shade in which the

coffin rests, the grave to which it is transported, the decorated church to which the

deceased man journeys for a Christian service, the homeland centre at Dhfilinybuy to

which the deceased is travelling, and the Christian's heaven, each of which appears to

be considered as a different transformation of the same reality.

            On the Sunday afternoon the coffin was transported from home on its
final journey. On the way it stopped at the church for a Christian service. The church
had been decorated with the dead man's clan symbols in the form of the cycad palm.
Four cycad palm trees formed an escort around a bed of cycad branches on which the
coffin rested.The "Youth", combined with the "Women's Club" performed a Biriya
buvgul (Prayer ceremony) which was a sung and danced Christian song. One man

spoke out the good qualities of the deceased, a brief sermon was preached and then a
second dance movement was performed to the Christian song "Take me home Lord"
After this the coffin was carried out to the truck for the last stage of the journey to the
graveside.At the graveside another brief ceremony was performed which included
Christian affirmations that,"Uncle is now in heaven waiting for us. His body is here,

but his spirit is home. Whether we believe it or not there is a home for us." The coffin
was lowered into the grave as a Yoliju traditional leader (dalkamunirr) cried the
ceremonial invocations (dalkaua). A Christian chorus is sung continually and some
women begin a traditional mourning wail at the same time as the grave is filled in.
When this is completed, bunches of both real and artificial flowers are arranged on the
mound. A further traditional song is sung and everyone goes home. It is now after
sunset and the dead man has been buried beside his father and his father's brother.
There is a spoken intention to put a concrete slab on the grave after the wet season.

            CONCLUSION.
            The passage through life does not end at death. As has been described, the
processing of the dead is a changing ritual (its outside form) but is in the Yoliju
understandings, apart from slight variations in interpretation, able to be considered as
unchanging in its intention. That is, the ritual purpose as far as the dead person is
concerned is to ensure satisfactory transfer of that individual to the inside place of the
afterlife, from the outside. The unchanging, but continually transforming identity has
made its final transformation to an afterlife which, while vaguely understood to be a
transformation of earthly existence, is not rigidly interpreted.

            Discussion of the afterlife and of the journey to the place of life after death
has shown that while there is a generally accepted existence of the individual after
death, there are a great number of variations of what that means. I have suggested
however, that all the various interpretations can be considered as analogues of each
other.
            As has been shown some of the transformations that the human passes
through during a lifetime are celebrated in rites of passage, and in some of these the
actual bodies are marked with indication of the particular state achieved. Thus the rites
can be considered as marking in both a physical and a ritual sense the successive steps

or transformations towards the fullest expression of the individual's unchanging
identity, rather than being thought of as marking changes. 29

              I have, in the discussion of the turtle rope song, also demonstrated how
the perceptions of these transformations can be celebrated in myth and song. It can
also be seen that treatment of the analogically perceived layers of interpretation as "just
the same" exemplifies the contrast between the Western use of quantitative equality
and the Yoluu use of qualitative equivalence.

              In the introduction to this chapter, I described the three Yoiuu notions;
              a. unity between whole and part,
              b. the perceptions and categories ofliving, and
              c. the ways in which living things are perceived to transform over time.

              The relevance of these three conceptualisations to Yoluu understandings
of the human being undergoing the various transformations of life should now be
apparent.
              When these three notions are combined with the earlier discussed concepts
of "inside" and "outside" aspects of existence, it becomes possible to understand the
ways in which Yoiuu are able to perceive the human identity as having an unchanging
eternal existence irrespective of apparent "outside" changes. This was beautifully
illustrated by Rrurrambu in his use of the metamorphosis of the butterfly to illustrate
transformation without change. He says that the butterfly does not change what it is,
only its outside form, and then observes that its identity is not only the butterfly but
that it is simultaneously each of its other transformations.
              In these ways the passage through life represents the process of an
identity gradually transforming from an almost unformed state to its full expression as
it enters it at death; the whole being a justification of the presupposition that identity
does not change.

29 The actual body marlcings such as circumcision, tooth evulsion and cicatrices being permanent,
function as visible signs olthe transfonnation that has occurred and the present state of the individual's
maturity and ritual status.

            THE PERSONAL COSMOS.

            INTRODUCTION                    A HUMAN WORLD.

            In this chapter I examine some aspects of Y olJJu kinship. Where I do this,

it is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of the kinship system. Rather I

attempt to examine those features which enable an understanding of the human

cosmos, that network of relationships within which the individual exists. The kin

networks are shown to be of major importance to a man or woman in being able to

determine or recognise their identity, which is to a large extent understood in terms of

the unique place of the individuals within the wider network of relationships.


            As soon as I began asking questions concerning Yol:ou perceptions of the

cosmos, it became obvious that it was of great importance to the individual to be able

to express their identity in terms of these relationships. I asked a number of men and

women to draw pictures of their world. Often, though not always, what was drawn

was a diagram, not of themselves in a physical world, but of themselves centred in a

network of relationships. For example Gapany, one of the YolJJu school teachers,

drew a very quick sketch which I have schematised below in Figure 4.1. In this she

paid attention first to those kin whose names are included in the figure and then

generalised the larger environment in the terms that I have included in the larger

circles, the categories of work-related people being the last additions.


            Some time later her husband Maratja, told me about the world he lives in

and then drew it for me. In doing so he demonstrated that he also perceived his entire

world as composed of people, and people related together in a single great network of

relationships. His initial response was,

            Me and my family. What's their association links, ties, affiliations, affects
      me generally. There is order of importance in my family which I normally
      respect, because what I do affects them directly or indirectly. Then there's what's
      called the extended family.




                                           127
                                                            Chapter 4 - The Personal Cosmos.


              He then drew and began to explain the drawing reproduced in Figure 4.2.

In this drawing the centre represents Maratja. The inner circle of circles, he said,

              represents the galldpuy(close) relations like mother, father, mother's
       brother, sister, wife, children, sister's children, all those named actual close
       relations. The extended family is represented by the outer circle. It is the mother's,
       father's and wives' relations, wakupulu, JJiindi'pulu, mliripulu, yapapulu.1
       Through the extended family we enter into the fabric, the framework of our
       society. It is this that makes us Y oJ.uu people unique. Sadly this is being altered
       by both external and internal influences. The internal pressures come from people
       not following where society directs. This shakes the society and brings unrest
       and feeling of unpeace in the community.


              When I then asked, "What is external to that world?" his first response

was to ask the question. "Is there any?" When I emphasised that that was the question

I was asking, he expanded his earlier explanation by adding that,

             There are lot of other peoples, lot of tribes, lot of tongues, lot of race, and
       the pressure that come with that, the adaptability and adaptations. Then there's
       God. He's everything and like the sustainer who sustains and preserves all
       things.


              During later discussion •. he added that, "around the outside of the drawing

are the songs and magayin that describe the relationship, and they're identifying

themselves in terms of the places and the creatures," and then asked the question,

"How do Balanda (white people) identify with the creatures?" There was in his

question a clear indication that he was considering identification with rather than

identification of the creatures. It was a clear statement of the focus of the Yolou

perception of the world, that is, that the cosmos was composed of relationships, and to

describe it then required the description of people and things in networks of

relationships. "Identification", in the sense that he was using it here, included the

notions of identifying with and relating to. The Yoluu consider themselves to be in an

identifiable relationship with all people and all living things as well as being in

relationship with the land. These relationships appear to be understood as existing

before birth and, as was shown in the preceding chapter, they also appear to be

considered as continuing after death. When looked at from some perspectives these

relationships also appear to have an aspect of predestination about them. In the

following narrative it is apparent that Maratja sees himself as being in close

relationship with plants and animals, sacred objects and clans through his pre-birth

experiences and identity as yam.

             My mother found ganguri(=gulaka, [a yam ,Vignaradiata]) at
      Dhugupu:our -0unha gali' (At Dhugupu on the other side) [a place on Gunbirrdji
      land about four Km north of Galiwin'ku township]. !junhi rraku wii-0a (That's
      my place) because I was found there. Mother was camping there with Willy and
      his wife and other relations, and went out hunting for yams, and they found this
      one abnormal yam. It was yindi mirithirr (big extremely), with lots of shoots and
      they filled a whole sugar bag with one plant After that there were a lot of old
      ladies there and they knew straight away. This is a sign that a new baby is
      coming, and my mother started to feel giggles and excitement Then they heard
      some clapping in the jungle, and after that they went fishing , and everyone
      caught a lot of fish and were so happy and the old people knew that mother was
      expecting me, and there was so much food and nearly everyone here had some,
      and even the missionaries here had a taste of those yams. That ganguri had a
      hairy surface, and the hairs were all cleaned off. People notice that now I have
      very little hair on my skin and see a similarity.
             During the revival there were lots of baptisms, but I didn't get baptised
      with them then. I was convicted by the Spirit at that time. In 1984 I was baptised.
      When they said the baptism in 1984 was to be at Dhugupu I felt that to be
      baptised there was meaningful to me in the sense of that place's association with
      the announcement of my mother's pregnancy.
             These clans have ganguri I gulaka; Djambarrpuyuu -Wa:oarr-manamirr
      (Djambarrpuy:ou who have mi£!1a the shark as theirs), Djapu and Galpu. They all
      dance it. It is linked to Bulwunu (east wind) and to Banumbirr.(Moming Star)
      BaJgurr (Brachychiton paradoxis) also connects to Djambarrpuy:ou -Wa:oarr-
      manamirr.
         - Concerning magayin. (Sacred things) Bu!'manydji (shark) is the main one,
      but sing and dance ganguri, though not as much as the other two clans.
            My place, Djawal':our I Garra1a. Magayin name Binyambi =Gurala (yindi
      yaku) Dha.QalJJu, Bulku, or Bulku:our. Nambatj:ou, Gurru:oal:oal, towards secret
      sacred names.
            Maratja means maranydjalk (Ga wukalau or namal [names for stingray]).
      Bulku is a place I bay where there are lots of gawukalau and young sharks. It is
      both a general term for that type of place and a specific name for the shark's site.


            In this narrative Maratja describes himself not just as being in relationspip

with yam, but as if the yam and he are so close that it could be described as being one

aspect of him. He also demonstrates a strong feeling of relationship with the site at

Dhugupu where his mother found him (as yam) and he affirms this relationship with

the place at his Christian baptism.


                                         130
                                                                   Chapter 4 - The Personal Cosmos.


              Through the yam and its associations he sees himself (as a member of his

clan) as being in relationship with the members of two other clans both of which share

relationships with his own clan because each of them is related to the sacred version

of the yam. His thoughts then seem to flow on automatically to other patterns of

relationships with these clans through the shark and other significant things. This flow

of thought then leads to the major site to which his clan relates, and from the name of

one of the smaller sites there to an association or relationship with it through the fact

that his own name, Maratja, is the name of one of the stingrays found at that place. 2


              Maratja was exploring the idea of whether he, as yam, was therefore food

for the people, for he is a well educated young man and a bible translator, and was

considering whether one of his roles was to be a bible teacher for the Christian

community. He was in this exploring the idea of whether God had predestined him in

this way, and given the yam to his mother as an indication of his role in the

community. He was also seeking to draw together his Y olIJu experience and his

Christian experience into a harmonious relationship. 3


              These examples from Maratja and Gapany, serve to indicate the core of

the approach taken by the Y olIJu in the understanding of the cosmos. The world is

composed of relationships firstly between close kin, then more distant kin and other

peoples, and at the periphery come relationships with the non-human environment

which is seen not so much as a set of objects that can be identified but as a set of

identities between which relationships exist. It is in this "network" that the Y olIJu

exist, and it is in the precise definition of the network of the individual's relationships

that his own identity is understood.

home "G:iru4Jur", which 1S the name of an important jungle yam site.

              Different sections of this chapter will explore the networks of

relationships so neatly summarised by Maratja and Gapany, taking them a level at a

time, and moving outward from the nuclear family which functions to focus the entire

cosmos on the individual. There is no clear boundary which will define those who are

galkipuy (close) relations from those who are more distant but near, nor is there a

distinct boundary between those and more distant YolIJu people. The distinctions as

they occur in the framework of this chapter are arbitrary ones that I have made for the

purposes of description. Nevertheless there is a world of closely relating persons

which changes relative to an individual over time.


              Beyond the close world's network there is a much wider world of

gurrupnnirri (lit. relationship-having)4 and beyond that there is the whole Yol1Ju
community, for all of whom the potential exists for the recognition of named

relationships which can be established by tracing relations between actual close kin

and intermediate ones. In this way the entire YolIJu population of some 3-5000 people

is able to be seen as being not only potentially, but actually "in relationship", although

the particular relationships may not yet have been identified.


  THE CLOSE WORLD : RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE
                                            FAMILY.

              The close world is composed of those galkipuy (close) relations with

whom ego relates on a day to day basis. These as Peterson (1974) and Shapiro (1973)

have clearly demonstrated, in discussing aspects of Y ol:gu kinship, change over time.

They are a much wider group of people than is thought of as immediate kin in

Western society. To give some idea of the set of kin who form the network in which




4 Shapiro (1981:41) translates this tenn as "aggregate to which kin terms literally apply" but the
meamng is more flexible than this and gurrufum.irri appears to refer to those kin to whom an actual
relationship can be traced through the kinship system. Those included in this category in any particular
context of its use will be those iliat it is relevant or politically expedient to include m that context.

Yolvu life is embedded at any period of time, I will examine a number of actual

household networks.


             For any individual person, there is a gradual though continuous

transformation in the group of people who make up the close family. This process of

change is well documented in anthropological literature (e.g. Goody 1958) and has

been discussed by both Peterson and Shapiro in some detail. 5 The material that I will

present here is complementary to rather than in contrast to the evidence they have

presented. One thing that stands out about my own observations is that while the

geographic situation is different from that discussed by Peterson, and the town has

changed considerably since the period discussed by Shapiro, yet there are underlying

principles of social action which have remained consistent One factor in the present

town situation which was not so intrusive in the earlier situations is the development

of improved housing. Living in houses places certain restrictions on the size of

households, so too does a shortage of housing. With fifteen to a house being common

and some households having more than twenty members in a two or three bedroom

house, the pressure for space can be intense.


             The individual Yo4)u is born into an already existing domestic

arrangement which goes through a series of changes as time passes, each person

experiences growing older and the individuals undergo the gradual process of moving

through the different levels of social and/or religious categories. 6 Fortes (1958:3)
discussing the developmental cycle of domestic groups suggests that, "Residential

patterns are the crystallization, at a given time, of the development process".




5 Peterson made his observations in the small geographically separated communities on the mainland
which are presently referred to either as homeland centres or as outstations. Shapiro's study of these
transfmnations was in the town of Galiwin'ku itself in the mid 1%08 when the town was simply
called Elcho Island.
6 As discussed more fully in the previous chapter.

              Assuming this to be so it is valid to consider that the transformations of

the individual's domestic situation can be generalised as following particular changes

in the patterns of living arrangements. These were identified at Elcho by the simple

process of observing who lives with whom. In this section I demonstrate the process

of change by examining the composition of relationships in a series of households.

These illustrate the types of changes that occur as the family of an individual divides,

expands and redivides. ·


              Prior to marriage, most young people remain in the same house as their

mother, father, brothers and sisters. This however is somewhat wider in connotation

than the understanding of modem, nuclear family oriented Western society. Mother's

sisters are also called and related to as mother, and father's brothers are called and

related to in the same way as father. Similarly all of mother's sister's children and

father's brother's children are called brother and sister, so that at any time a child may

be domiciled within any of a wide range of households though there appears to be a

general tendency for this to be oriented more toward the female parent's kin than the

male's. That is, if a child is not living in the home of its parents, it will probably be

living with an older sister, a mother's sister, a mother's mother, or a mother's mother's

sister. This focus on but not exclusive use of matrilocal arrangements for children

becomes apparent when the kinship patterns for various households are examined?.


              After marriage it appears to be the common practice for a young man to

move into the home I household of his new wife's mother and father to live with her8.

At some stage after they have begun to raise a family of their own, and apparently

depending largely on the availabilty of housing in the community, a young couple will

become the focus, or nucleus of a household of their own.




7 Shapiro in his studies apparently ignored the location of children
8 As noted by Peterson.


                                                 134

            In the two cases where I recorded what could be called nuclear family
households, the young couples had each moved out of the girl's home into a nearby
disused house that was of a poorer quality than the one they had left; one that was not
wanted by anyone else. One of these couples, a sister of Maratja and her husband,
already had two very lively children and in their separate residence they were almost
permanently hosts for different members of the husband's family as they visited from
the neighbouring town of Yirrkala. The house they left had eleven residents and the
new house was about a hundred metres from her parent's house. The other couple
moved into a semi-derelict house opposite the wife's widowed mother's house to
establish their own home. While they then occupied separate houses it was in practice
still functioning as one household in that they still spent most of the day together and
still appeared to be eating together. This young couple had five children of their own
and there were thirteen people in her mother, M~una~u's house including two
married sons with their wives and children. The relationships between the residents of
these last two houses are shown in Figure 4.3.

            Maratja's family, discussed earlier, while a nuclear family, does not equate
with the Western concept of a nuclear family. He and his wife are a young couple
from two prestigious families with their own home, a house of intermediate quality. In

their household at the time I visited, there lived Maratja and Gapany and their three
children, Raparrk, Mathayalma and Warr:ggul. With them lived Maratja's sister
Mininybal, a single parent with her two children Ganyul and Bandawuy, and two
children of Gapany's sister (ijandama), Wan'kal and Djaymila. It is worth noting that
while the details are not exactly the same as the focus of Gapany's world as discussed
earlier, yet the members of the household fit within that focus being either brothers,
sisters or their children. (See the contrasts between Figures 4.1. and 4.4. ).

            By the time a new family has become independently housed, it appears
nonnal that, as in Maratja and Gapany's case, there will be other kin living with them.

 In a relatively brief time the eldest daughter will be the focus of a new marriage, and

 the cause of a new male becoming part of the household. In this way, the new

 household continues to expand. I did not have the opportunity to discuss in any detail
 the ways in which young polygynous households develop but it appears possible that
 this can happen in at least two different ways. It is possible that a man may stay in his
 wife's parental household until he has acquired one of her sisters as wife, though I
 collected no examples of this happening. What I have observed in several cases is that
 a man in a separately established household will bring a second and younger wife into
 it In one case a middle aged man left his established household at Elcho to go
 toYirrkala to live while he established a married relationship with a young promised

 wife from there. He had not returned to Elcho by the time I left, and I do not know
 whether he has brought the new wife back to his old home or whether he has stayed
 with her.

             When the children start to marry, the household begins to change in a
· variety of ways, with at first the increase due to incoming daughters' husbands and
 the arrival of grandchildren. I examined in detail a number of these households,
 finding the patterns of movement of people and the changes in households to follow
 fairly consistent patterns.

             Maratja's father was monogamous. In late 1990 he had become very ill
 with cancer of the mouth. The daughter who had been living with Maratja moved back
 into the home to help her mother and the other sisters to care for him. Three days

 befon: he died in April 1991 the distribution of his children and the members of his
 household were as shown in Figure 4.5. As a result of his death this household will
 undergo more changes in membership, but will probably, like the majority of
 households yet to be discussed, have an older woman as their focus.

             Rarrkminy, already a widow for many years, has around her, and living in
 the house with her two married daughters with their families plus several other

grandchildren. The grandchildren are the children of three daughter's who are

currently living in Darwin. This household, typical of the matriarchal stage of

transformation is illustrated in Figure 4.6. Each married daughter living at home has a

separate room for her family. At times when the remaining Darwin based families are

home, her daughters are likely to stay with her and the daughter's husband to stay with

the members of their own childhood households. Households where the husband was

polgamous follow this same pattern except that when the husband dies, if the wives

do not remarry, each tends to become the nucleus of a separate household.


              On the basis of the structures represented by these households, it is

possible to draw some simple conclusions about the changing cosmos of the

individual man and woman. 9 One thing which does appear from my own data, is that

each household appears to have within it a focal individual or a focal married couple.

This is not able to be compared adequately with either Peterson's or Shapiro's data.

Peterson however does indicate that there are what he calls "core" members of the

band. While he treats the band for the most part as a single unit he refers to separate

family groups within that whole and his "core" members have the possibility of being

interpreted as what I have termed focal individuals. However the data as presented

does not give a clear indication as to whether or not each of these core individuals

could be considered as the focus for particular members of the band.


              Shapiro's purpose was different from my own and by eliminating all

under 14 years, and by combining the residents of separate houses to form what he

describes as "households" (using that word in a different sense from me) he makes

any close comparison almost impossible.




9 Peterson (1974:24) examining such transformations over time in the small bush communities saw
them in terms of an oscillation between two models, one of which was the patrilocal group and the other
based on the uxoripatrilocal residence of younger married men. In the town situation these two models
are still clearly visible although the people are not living on their own estates.


                                                139
                                                           Chapter 4 - The Personal Cosmos.


            The households that I have examined make it possible to give some

indication of the transitions which occur in an individual's close world whether the

individual is male or female. A male child grows up in a close family group in a

household which will include his mother or one of her sisters, and probably also his

father although the father is not essential. At some stage he may move house to live

with one of his older, and possibly married brothers. At his first marriage he will in

normal circumstances, join the household where his new wife lives and stay there

until it is appropriate to move out with his wife and children. At that stage he will

most probably become the focus of a new household to which others of his own or

his wife's siblings, with or without children, are likely to adhere. For the rest of his

life until extreme old age and a renewed dependence on others, he is likely to remain

the focus of the household he is in. Men who remain single appear to attach to the

household of their father or to one of their older brothers and do not appear to become

the focus of any part of the household.


            A female child up until marriage will also remain in a household with her

mother or mother's sister. Again the father's presence is not essential. At marriage, if

she is a first wife, her husband will in most cases move in to live within her childhood

home. At some stage she will move to a different household where her husband will

probably be the focus. This will last until she is past childbearing. At that point if her

husband is still alive she may remain with him, but if he dies or if she is one of a

number of wives, she may then become the matriarch of a household which will

probably include her children single and married. It appears usual for this to include

married daughters, their husbands and children and less common to include married

sons. If, in contrast to this, she moves into a son's household, it is probable that the

son will share if not assume the focal position in the household.


            More frequently now than in the past women are choosing to remain

single. While the above outline is the general pattern of household transformation,



                                           140

there are a number of single mothers, who, while acknowledging the father(s) of their

child(ren) may choose to live without a male and will usually reside in the home of

one of their parents or that of another sister. Very occasionally a single mother will

live in a brother's household.




THE NEAR WORLD                     RELATIONS BEYOND THE CLOSE
                                     FAMILY.

             Beyond the close world are those relations who are collectively known by

the term gurrutu'mirri!]u (relations).10 There is a complex set of kin terms applied to

these relations, and the discussion of these terms together with the relationships they

represent form a comprehensive literature. (Warner, Webb, Shapiro, Morphy and

Keen and many others). The hypothetical system for the terminology is shown in

Figure 4. 7. Whereas most descriptions of the terms go no further than five generations

on the basis that the central ones make up the full system, I have, following

observations of the references used by different Yoluu, chosen to extend it two further

generations in both ascent and descent from ego to peripheral kin and those forebears

and descendants not likely to be living at the same time as a person who may refer to

them. It is not until this is done that some of the conceptual framework behind the

system appears clearly. Irrespective of whether ego is male or female, the terms

shown are the one that ego uses in reference to the person occupying the particular

relationship position shown.


             Warner (1937/58:59) represented the YollJu kin terms as covering seven

patrilines linked by marriage. Shapiro (1981 :38) apportions these same kin terms to

what he calls "seven kinds of social unit", but then lists these seven kinds as each




10 See Footnote 3.


                                          141

being a separate sib (his term for a locality oriented patrilineal group) so in practice

has represented seven patrilines the same as Warner, in spite of some small

differences in detail and in the choice of dialect from which the terms are recorded.


              I was interested to discover just how far the Y ol1Ju were prepared to

extend the terminology, and discovered this to be a mental exercise that they really

enjoyed. It was not difficult for them to take terms beyond the nine intermarrying

lineages which make up the core of Figure 4.10. I have chosen not to go further than

the limits of the present figure, because it is at nine generations and nine lineages that

some of the most interesting features of the relationship system become clear.11


              In the figure, I have marked the terms which are repeated in both

patrilineal and matrilineal descent lines, and it can be seen in these sets of terms that if

one takes ego as the focus and moves back to the fourth generation a term is reached

that is the same as the term used for ego's child in that line or to the fifth generation to

one that is the same as ego. Similarly if one moves down to the fourth generation a

term is reached that is the same as the term used for ego's parent in that line and to the

fifth to a further repeat of the terms for ego. Counting outward from ego with ego as

the first generation the third generations both upward and downward are the ones in

which the most important reciprocal ceremonial relationships are found. That is, those

relationships between the male individuals labelled miiri, wiiwa and gutharra. In his

world, as generation succeeds generation, a man moves from the lowest of the three

terms in generation and ceremonial importance to the highest.12


              The relationship between thesethreematrilineallyrelatedmen (miiri, wiiwa

and gutharra) is one of the most critical and one of the most interesting in the whole




l l To record the terms as I have done gives the impression that the panicular relationships shown in the

relationship system. If the person called mari by ego and the person called gutharra by

ego refer to each other by kinship terms, each calls the other wiiwa (brother). Each

also calls the sister of the other by the term for sister (yapa). I became interested in the

implications of this repetition and as I was discussing the kinship system with a group

of women, I posed the following proposition to them,

            "We call yapa and old yapa by the same name, 'yapa'. If they have the same
       name there has to be something the same about them."


               The response I received still amazes me. One of Rarrkminy's daughters of

burstoutimmediatelywithgreatexcitement,

             It's the ma.ffayin (sacred elements). They have the same magayin. It goes
       back inside through the women.


               There is immense implication for understanding the structure of the

relationship system in this one outburst. There are three generations between the

repeated terms 'yapa', or for that matter between any of the repeated terms in the

central area of direct matrilineal orp.atrilineal descent between any yapa/wiiwa sibling

pair in the network of terms. Given that alternative patrilines are of the opposite

moiety, the yapa/wiiwa sibling pair and either mari or gutharra between them in the

matriline are all from the same moiety.


              First, third and fifth generations, being of the same moiety, share the same

sacredness of the one moiety, but it is the central one of the three who carries the

sacred knowledge from the first to the fifth generation as it is the first and fifth

generations which share their identities through sharing the same sacred objects 13.

When Yurranydjil gave her excited answer it was to this relationship between the first

and fifth generations that she was referring. The old yapa with her brother share one

sacredness. This goes inside (where it is not overtly perceived) through the next three

matrilineal generations of women and then comes outside again in the form of the

wiiwa/yapa sibling pair of the fifth generation.

            If however instead of thinking of the magayin as sacred objects, one

considers them as being the representations of the elements of the individual's identity,

the significance of this transference becomes more apparent. It means that

arrangements are so made that by arranging matrilineal transfer in accordance with the

hypothetical system, the children who have a pre-existence with a particular clan's

identity will be born to women who are in the clan relationship of being mothers to the

clan of the pre-existing children. In that way the child inherits its identity from both

mother through the matriline and father through the patriline. It is this transfer of

sacredness which appears to be one of the most significant purposes behind the

bestowal of women. This bestowal of women then functions not as a bestowal of

wives as property, but of women to be mothers for children of the right identity and

sacredness. These mothers and their clans together with the set of clans in this

sequence are alluded to frequently as the yalu (nest), an analogue of both the womb

and the sacred inner (or unseen) dimension.


            Superimposed over the kinship network there has been introduced a

further set of classifications generally described as subsection terms. These terms,

known collectively as miilk, neatly follow the matriline. According to Elcho Yoluu

this has occurred in relatively recent times. One man said to me that,

             ....... 's grandfather brought the miilk here at the same time as he brought the
      Gunapipi (ceremony)

            Already operating when Warner was doing his fieldwork in the late

1920s, the miilk can most simply be described as two sets of four terms, each with

male and female forms which classify the entire Y olIJu population into eight inter-

relating categories. As an individual's miilkdepends on that of his mother and they are

inherited matrilineally, alternate generations of a set are of opposite moieties.

Displayed in Figures 4.8 and 4.9, are the positions of the two sets in the relationships

that develop as what are called first choice and second choice marriages.


            The Ideal Marriage Pattern.

The galldpuy (close) family is embedded within the wider kinship network. The

pattern by which this is established is related to three things; the movement of women

between clans, the relations between groups and sacred objects, and finally the relation

between these and particular sites in the landscape. There are both ideal patterns for

this movement of women and actual patterns. The ideal patterns are those that I have

taken to represent the cosmology expressed in relationships. The actual patterns are

often somewhat different A marriage between two people which follows the

traditional system brings into fruition the relationship between groups which has been,

in most cases, established long before the two individuals were conceived. In my

inquiries as to how a man obtained a wife I asked Rarrkminy, a senior woman from

the Djambarrpu~u Gundapuy group to explain to me how the marriage system

worked. Her response was given in terms of a set of sites which give their daughters

as potential mothers for the children of another set of sites.


            According to Rarrkminy (making a deliberate simplification to explain the

hypothetical system), there are, from the perspective of the DjambarrpuyJJu Gundapuy

clan, four sets of sites involved in a circular transfer of daughters. These groupings

are represented in the Figure 4.10. Daughters are given from one group of sites to

any of the sites in the next set, in the direction of the arrows. It is of great significance

that all of the sites in a set share some major sacred object. Thus all the sisters of

clansmen in that set carry the same sacredness within them as their brothers. When a

woman gutharra is given to a male dhumungurto bear his children, their daughters

will be the vama (mothers) for a new generation of men and women who manifest the

same sacredness as the clan members of the original set of sites. In this way the

matriline carries hidden within it, for three generations, the sacredness of the set of

clans and sites, as was described in the earlier quote from Yurranydjil. By following

this pattern of bestowal, the continuation of the sacred identity of each site is

guaranteed even if the patriline dies out and is replaced by decendants from the

matriline. The retention of the sacred identity within the limited group of clans of the

set ensures that the control of the spiritual entities and hence also the rariga (sacred

objects) and sites are retained by a closely affiliated clan. Within this mechanism also

lies the foundation for the transference of site responsibility from one clan to another

within the members of a set.

are predominantly coastal, as well as being a part of the cyclical pattern, has

established a separate mutual exchange relationship with three other sites (also shown

in the same figure). Within these alternative distributions lie potential for developing

relations with other groups of sites in different sets. I do not wish to follow these

links here beyond indicating that they exist and that they also give a further example of

. the interweaving of the complex networks of relationships across Arnhem Land.


             For Rarrkminy the ideal marriage pattern for the group of clans to which

she belongs is represented by the passage of daughters from one set of sites to the

next set of sites. The contributing group of sites is seen as in the relationship of :(}iindi

(mother) to the receiving set which is in the reciprocal relationship of waku (sister's

child). Each of the sites in the receiving set is thus seen to be in the relationship of

 waku to :gii.ndi to the site from which the bearers of their children come. They are the

"bearers of the clan's children" in two separate senses. They bear physical children,

but they also are bearers of the spiritual identity of those children as well. The set of

terms used to name the relationships are the same set of terms just discussed which

classify the relationships between the women in ego's matriline.

               Rarrkminy and her brothers belong to Gundapuy - Djambarrpu}'Uu clan

and hence simultaneously to the place known as Djawal':gur. The clans coming from

Rorru and :rjurruyurrtjurr combined together with her clan in the lower left of Figure

4.10, form a single set. They are in a yapa (sister) relationship to her own clan and the

sites are in a yapa relationship to Djawal':gur, though she does not call her site or her

own patrilineal clan by that term.14 The three sites have some major magayin (sacred

objects) in common, and this holds them in a close relationship to each other. The fact

that they are in apparent degree of competition concerning who actually receives the

gifts of daughters as mothers for their clan, could be expected to create a degree of

tension between them.


               In the figure the next group in the direction of the arrow is made up of the

clans from Dholtji, Dhaliny:gur and Gurrumuru, all of which are Yirritja sites. It is to

them that Rarrkminy and the other daughters from her group of sites are given as

mothers for the children of these sites and as mothers-in-law for the children of the

next group. These sites in the second set are waku (sister's child) to the sites in her

own set. Her actual children will also be called waku by herself, and by her brothers

and sisters.


               The sites which supplied Rarrkminy's mother to bear children for her

father's and hence her own clan, Na:ginyburra, and Maiamaia, are in her clan's

f)iindipulu. That is the set of sites/clans in the relationship of mother to her clan and to

herself. These two different W arramiri clans supply the women to bear children not

only for her clan, but to the other two clans in her group which she calls her yapapulu.

The group of clans in a sister relationship to her clan.


               Continuing to follow the arrows in the reverse direction the sites Marapay

and Garn yak are in the relation of mother's mother to her own set of sites. The sites



14 A person calls their own clan lineage their yarrata (lit. string).

and the clans in the group are in the relation of mliri to her group, and she calls all the

members of those clans her mliripulu (mother's mother's set of clans). She calls them

mliri, and they call her gutharra (sister's daughter). However because of the circular

pattern of the transfer of women, her group of clans is also in the relationship of

mliripulu to them, although her own gutharra (daughter's children) belong to the site

and the group.15


              Her mliripulu set receive mothers for their children from Dholtji,

Dhfiliny:uur and Gurrumuru. Her mliripulu set calls these sites !Jlindipulu; the set that

supplies their mothers and the sites that are in !Jandi relationship to their sites.

Rarrkminy's set of clans refers to them as their mother's mother's mothers or waku.

The set of sites/clans in this relationship are her wakupulu. Where the actual matriline

has followed the ideal around the circular pattern, this means that Rarrkminy's sons

and daughters (whom she calls waku or sister's child) will belong to a clan and a site

related to her clan and site as their mother's mother's mother. They are wakupulu

because of this relationship, that is as children of her yapa clan, not because they are

her children. In this way, she as !Jlindi for the group is the final of the three stages of

the "inside" transfer of their magayin. She is !Jlindi in the dual sense of having born

their children who are waku to her, and also brought out into the open for her

wakupulu (mother's mother's mother's clan) those who will continue the wakupulu's

magayin (sacredness).


              Through this circular pattern there is a set of sites and a corresponding set

of clans relating together in a theoretically fixed structure. Any one site/clan within a

set can give daughters to any of the clans in the next set. This was Rarrkminy's

explanation of the ideal, but as she said, sometimes the daughters can be given in the

opposite direction, though the relationships between the sites appear to be fixed.




15 It appem:s that while IJOOple, sites and sacred items can be in a reciprocal milri:gutharrarelationship, a
clan can only be milriplilu to another, there being no termgutharrapulu.

Within the ideal was room for flexibility and the three sites with the separate

relationships of exchange of daughters with Marapay are part of this. Rarrkminy's

own waku'minigu (actual mother's mother's mother) had come from one of them.


              A different "ideal" set of sites, which pass on their daughters in the same

way as Rarrkminy described was listed by Nyambi from the Gumatj Yunupi:gu clan

whose homeland is at Buranyburany. The pattern of relationships which he identified

included some of those places that were in Rarrkminy's sets, keeping them in the same

relationships to each other as they were in hers. He also replaced some of the ones in

her list with some locations that were in an established relationship to his own group,

describing the same giving of women to be mothers for the clans in the same direction

as she had. (See Figure 4.11.) Keen's (1978:131) descriptions of cycles of marriage

over six lineages appear to be able to be superimposed over these ideal patterns, as

where these overlap with the contents of of the two figures, the sequences are found

to match.


              The fact that these two sets maintain constant relationships through the

transformation from one clans perspective to that of another's appears to indicate the

possibility that there is a way that all the clans in Arnhem Land could be fitted into

four groups. If this was so it would neatly establish the semi-moieties claimed by

Shapiro (1981:109). I was not however able to establish this consistency and I also

obtained some patterns which conflicted with the above two sets.16 The two sets

while consistent with each other also contain variations from the groupings of clans

given by Shapiro, with some clans in the opposite quadrants from his lists. All this

appears to prove is that within the Y oI:uu cosmos there is some idea of sets of clans or

sites functioning in this way. In practice however, the ideal seems to vary from group




16 Shapiro ( 1981.110) noted that these groupings of clans were not universally agreed with, there is,
however, the possibility that we both mi.Sse<f su6tle discriminations being made between different
lineages of the clans in question.

 to group in accord with what may be the attempts of different individuals to

 manipulate the ideal in their own favour.


              In addition to the notion of an ideal relation between sites which governs

 the movement of women and the obtaining of wives, there are several alternative ways

 by which a man may obtain a wife.17 A man may marry a woman who is mother's

 brother's daughter, or mother's mother's brother's daughter's daughter, who is the

 daughter of his milmarra (promised wife's mother). These descriptions may or may

 not refer to the same woman, and either of these could, but may not necessarily neatly

 fit the ideal system just described. The levirate, common in the past, was an alternative

 way of obtaining a wife, but appears to be becoming less common than it was. I can

 suggest two factors which may be affecting this but there may be others also. Firstly

 men are living longer with the improved health care, and there being less disparity in

 the ages of spouses, when a man dies his wives are often now beyond the age for

 child bearing. Secondly, women appear to be more autonomous than they were and

 widow's pensions and supporting mother's benefits have given them more economic

 freedom than they had previously.


              Imposed over the top of the kinship system, is the miilk (subsection)

 system (Figures 4.8 and 4.9 ).18 This system provides one further way of supporting

 an argument in favour of the legitimacy of a proposed marriage. Such argument is

 then based on whether a couple are in right relationship according to the optimum

 miilk terminology. The system is used by the Y ol1Ju chiefly to support such arguments

 as may have weak or non-existent support through the genealogical system, and is

 consistently treated as having less significance than the older system. As Scheffler

- (1978:496) says, "As far as the practical business of arranging marriages is



 17 All of these have been adequately described in the literature and I only comment on aspects which
 throw light on Yol:gu understandings of the cosmos.

concerned, the subsection system is not merely redundant, it is largely irrelevant". One

of its primary functions however is often ignored and that is its use in providing a

means of establishing what relationships exist with other non- Y oluu people, including

non-Aboriginal people, and as a way of referring to each other without using names

or kin classificatory terms (cf.Shapiro 1981:146). 19


               The marrying of manutjimirri (lit.eye-having= girlfriends) possible

occasionally in the past with considerable difficulty is now common, though this is

frequently frowned on by the parents of both on such grounds as the couple not being

in the right relationship, or one of them being below the status of the other.20 When a

marriage, no matter how non-traditional has become established and accepted,

attempts are made to "make things right". This may take the approach of changing the

man's relationships so that he is put into an acceptable category to be the woman's

husband, or it may be achieved by seeking to find some common links between the

families through commonly held sacred things. Rarrkminy, reminiscing on the

changes that have occurred in the establishment of marriages, describes the

justification that was achieved for the marriage of one of her daughters to, at that

stage, one of the most prestigious younger men in Arnhem Land. She said that,


               The old people kept rom (the system). Now use Balanda rom (white man's

system). No promises now, but gamunu.vgu rom (sacred design traditions). My

daughter was promised to ........ (a Marapay man), but married Djiniyini, and not right,

but one magayin (sacred object) [i.e. they had common ritual objects] for Geluu's miiri

(M.M.B.) and DjiniyiQi's vandi (mother) that is Mirinyivu (whale).21




19 It is interesting to note that being matrilineally: patterned and having foW' terms, it repeats at the fifth
and so forms one more exact fit w1ih the other inheritance structures that have thus far been discussed.
20 There is no notion of chastity before marriage, and a girl may have one or more children before
marriage, or with the assistance of the government's supporting mother's benefit, and help from her
close ffimily may chose to have children and remain sing1e.
21 The phrase gamunuvgurom (sacred design traditions) is an alternative expression for magayin rom
(sacred tradition or rule) and refers here, to trying to arrange or justify a marriage in such a way that
there is an appropriate relationship between die sacred objects of the clans of a couple.


                                                    155

             This justification has the appearance of being accepted at community level

as a Gupapuyuu man said to me that Djiniyini married Geluu and Danydjati (his

brother) married Lorru. The mother for both men is Wuymirri (whale) and the two

men and their fathers are also Wuymirri, so they could marry.22


             The normal "promise" system of arranging marriages, while being spoken

of here as being replaced by the white man's system has not completely gone and I

need to consider it briefly to draw out some of the ramifications of the earlier

discussion on the repeated terms in the matriline of the kinship system. In my

examination of relationships I encountered one case where marriage followed the

traditional promise system but has some additional aspects that illustrate the

significance of adoption.


             Da:gata:ga from the Golumala clan married Bandil from the Gumatj

Burarrwa:ga clan. His mother and her father are children of the same Gumatj man

although they had separate mothers. As a result of this relationship it can be shown

that Dauataua married his mother's brother's daughter, a correct marriage in every

respect (See Figure 4.12). Ceremonially, it is important for him to have married his

mother's mother's brother's daughter's daughter, which would establish a right

relationship between him and his male miiri (mother's mother's brother. Traced

through actual lineage, his real miiri is from the Djambarrpuy:gu Dhamarrandji clan

from Bremer Island, and his wife is his mother's mother's sister's son's daughter (See

Figure 4.13) However, his mother's actual parents died and she was adopted by a

Djapu woman married to a Ma:ggalili man. That Djapu woman's brother was Bandil's

vathi (mother's father). By tracing their marriage through the adoptive relationships,

Da:gata:ga is able to show that his wife is also his mother's mother's brother's




22 I suggest that this has the appearance of community aceptance but whether it is really widely
considered is unknown to me. While this second statement came from a GuJ!apuy:ou man, his mother is
Golumala, so he is in one sense part of the group who want this marriage to be seen to have been
achieved with all propriety.

daughter's daughter which is the optimum ceremonial relationship. (See Figure 4.14).

Nevertheless he considers that Djambarrpuy:ou is his first miiri and Djapu is his

second miiri, placing the actual genalogical line as being more important than the

adoptive one. The arrangement for his marriage was, he said, made for him by his two

miiri, referring in this case to the Djapu brother and sister. Da:oata:oa, describing this

from their perspective said that,

              A man gives a wife to his waku (sister's son) so that she will be milmarra
       (mother of a wife) for his gutharra (sister's daughter's son). So that man follows
       his sister's daughter to her son who then follows the line to his sister's daughter's
       son.


              This description of the successive bestowal of women, when

superimposed on the kin term chart, then forms another exact match with

Yurranydjil's declaration that the magayin (sacredness) goes inside through the female

line for three generations till it re-emerges at the point of repetition in the kinship

pattern23. It also fits exactly when superimposed on Rarrkminy's description of the

ideal marriage pattern. Here the transfer of women from group to group starts and

ends in the group of sites which share the same sacred items.


              On a different occasion Da:oata:oa gave me an entirely different explanation

of the system using drawings of the the yam plant transformation of Banumbirr (the

morning star) as a way of talking about relationships. In doing this he drew the

original sketches from which Figures 4.15, and 4.16 are reproduced. It should be

noted that these are alternative ways of explanation and not an alternative system. He

used Figure 4.15 as an illustration of his own clan's development which he described

as follows;


              "Banumbirr(the ritual pole with its tasselled strings) is like children

growing out of strings from father's seed, then there are grandchildren and soon more.




23 See earlier discussion on Yurranydjil' declaration.

                                                                     Chapter 4 - The Personal Cosmos.

               It is like the gu}'!Ja plant (a yam) that grows in the ground. The dharpa24 is
        the father and the stem of the plant, and the branches are his children. Golumala
        use Ma.ugalili and Lamamirri to produce. My miiri'muwu vandi (father's father's
        mother) was Warramiri and my father's vandi(mother) was Wangurri."


               After indicating that the soil in which the yam was growing represented

the mother, and hence the site from which the mother and her clan come, he drew a

series of three similar yam plants growing in different sites (Figure 4.16) saying that

one represented his father's father's mother who was Warramiri, one his father's

mother who was Wangurri and the third his own mother who was Lamamirri. Thus in

three generations three different relationships, with clans from three different sites,

had been activated in the growth of the clan.


               Da.uata.ua drew two other drawings to illustrate the ways in which Gapiny

clans relate together and also how Djapu clan can function as an intermediary with

them. The first of these drawings, Figure 4.17, illustrates the relations in terms of the

yam transform. In this case each yam represents a single clan and the intertwining of

. branches represents the relations between the group which, as they are described,

match exactly with the "ideal marriage patterns" described earlier.


               Da!iwuy, Golumala and ijaymil are guyva (yam). Each plant is separate,

but together bring fruit (offspring) to each other; milmarra (promised wife's mother)

or miiripulu (mother's mother's clan)or gutharra (daughter's daughter). A ijaymil

daughter25 might be maralkurfor Golumala. That starts fruit between. Djapu may be

maralkur for Golumala or ijaymil, or ij aymil for Djapu, or Golumala for Djapu or

Da!iwuy, or Da!iwuy for Djapu.




 24 Dharpa. (wood) is here referring to the wooden core of the ceremonial yam object. the wooden
 section of which represents the root section of the yam.
 25 There is a difficultf. in this quote in the use of the word daughter in English to translate the YoJuu
 word gitthu (man's child of eitlier sex}. Maralkuris tenn for the wife's mother's brother when viewed
 from the perspective of the receiving individual, a man who has responsibility for the distribution of his
 sister's daughters in marriage.


                                                  162
                                                                    Chapter 4 - The Personal Cosmos.


              The intention of his statement appears to be that, the female child of a

Dhuwa man of one clan in the group is potentially a wife's mother for children of

another clan in the group. In saying this he was listing the clans that are in the one

group linked by Banumbirr(the Morning Star) and saying that as the women produce

children, that through the matriline there will come back to other members of the

group women who will bear more children with the same magayin (sacredness) and

hence more who share the common aspects of the identity of the group.


              This same relationship was expressed in an entirely different way in

relation to the travels of Banumbirr(the Morning Star) and the sites that are linked by

these travels. Drawn from the last ofDauataua's sketches (see Figure 4.18.) it relates

Djapu clan as marl (mother's mother's clan) to the next groups in the journey, with

them being in a reciprocal relationship of mliri to Djapu. This too exactly fits the above

mentioned marriage patterns in that it exemplifies two groups of clans of one moiety

being in a reciprocal marl (mother's mother) relationship to each other. As it was

drawn in the figure (which ignores the Djapu connection), Banumbirrmoves from

East to West, following the direction of movement of the actual morning star across

the succession of clan territories that are linked by the ceremonial complex.

26According to Dauaraua,

             all come from one mother, and all have one father who is Djapu. All the
       other clans and sites are mliri (mother's mother) to Djapu, but also Murru:gun -
       Gunbirri, Gondarra, ijaymil and Da,!iwuy call Djapu mliri, while at the same time
       being mliri for Djapu.


              In this he is placing the origins of the Morning Star with the Djapu clan,

and hence the initiative for using it as a basis for establishing relations with them.




26 It should be noted that this is his summary according to a GolumaJa clan [Gondarra] p_erspective.
Other versions of the travels list different clans related together by Banwnbirr but rather than cancel out
any of the details he supplied, these tend to supplement them according to the focus of the speaker at the
time.

              Each of the separate descriptions of ways to achieve marriage that have

been discussed to this point, apart from the "sweetheart" arrangement, has the

potential to overlap with each of the others so that it is possible, at least in theory, to

fulfil all the systems, including the mlilk system, simultaneously. Throughout all the

systems, ideals and variations of description that I have presented in this section it is

possible to see a common strand which, represents the ideal marriage as that between

a man and his mother's mother's brother's daughter's daughter as has been adequately

shown by Keen (1978) and Morphy (1977). This is however the pattern from the

perspective of a man gaining a wife. The bestowal pattern is more complex than this.

Viewed matrilineally, a man's aim is to so establish arrangements between other clans

that his sister's daughter's son will control the bestowal of his sister's daughter's

daughter's daughter in such a way that she will produce children who will care for his

magayin (sacred items) and who will in fact be living transformations of his magayin
in the same way that he is. Within this pattern of the bestowing of women and the

caring for sacred items is the basis for almost if not all the patterns of obligations

between clans.


                   THE MORE DISTANT WORLD: RELATIONS
                                   BETWEEN               CLANS.

              To this point I have simply identified Yol:ou groups by recording

whatever name a particular group has been given when being discussed. Yol:ou

groups have proven difficult for Anthropologists to classify according to any fixed

set of determining characteristics. I am not convinced that a fully satisfactory solution

has been recorded. I certainly have not found any single factor or set of factors which

can be adequately applied to all groups.27 Warner (1937/58:33) appears to have




27 Part of this is because the Yol9u appear to identify gi:o01>s by a whole range of factors, but not to
identify all groups by the same sorts of things. The result oI this is that a number of groups appear to be
identified by umque sets of factors.


                                                  164

decided that the basic Yol:uu social unit was a patrilineal group which he identified by

the term "clan". This is the term that the YoJ:uu use when speaking in English, though

not necessarily with the same English meaning as Warner. R.Bemdt ( 1976:135)

claimed that these groups could be discretely identified using the paired mala/matha

classifications and so the groups which he identified as,

             a dialect unit which is also a territorially anchored unit substantiated by its
       linked mala, which in tum provides the mythic justification for its spatial
       grouping


              Shapiro noted ( 1981 :20) that the YoJ:uu "call such a unit a mala in secular

contexts, a baparru [blipurru] in ritual ones". Matha, meaning language, is certainly

one satisfactory determinant, but mala simply means plural or group or multiple and

there is a problem in its use to classify such groups. It is simply a term for "group"

and refers to any group at any level. Shapiro, searching for a more appropriate label

chose the word "sib" for the same group. Of the sib he says,

             Sib charters are non-genealogical. All the members of some, though by no
       means all, sibs are demonstrable agnates, but whether or not this is so is not
       culturally important. Rather the unity of the sib is expressed in terms of its
       association with a particular estate, and with the ritual and mythic forms
       connected with that estate.


              In addition to the problem of finding an adequate terminology to

unambiguously identify such basic groups, there is an added complication in that the

YoI:uu processes of identifying groups of different kinds overlap with each other at

any apparent single level of grouping. 28 A good number of groups can be identified

by a combination of the language they speak, their major religious site, and whether

the location of their sacred objects is in a salt water or a fresh water place. These are

the types of basic social units that Warner, Berndt and Shapiro have attempted to

identify, the groups I have chosen to call "clans" (following Keen, Morphy and in

some cases, Warner). The meaning which should be attributed to that term depends on




28 They also simultaneously overlap with each other between different hierarchical levels.

Yol:uu.

              Not all groups appear to be able to be identified in this way and, to

complicate the apparently simple task of identifying the groups we are considering,

there are a whole range of different bases by which groups link together in larger
affiliations and sometimes these larger affiliations are given the same names as are
applied to the "clans".

            It is appropriate here to examine some of the complications of the Yol1Ju
process of identification of groups and of individuals. To do this I will consider some
aspects of the groupings of people who fall into the category "Djambarrpuy1Ju". I
have examined the cosmos of human relationships at the level of the individual and his
close world, the individual in the changing structure of residential groups over time,
and the individual within the networkof intermarrying clans.

            Some of the very large groups such as Djambarrpuy1Ju are a source of
difficulty in identifying just what is or who are being referred to by the use of the
name. Djambarrpuy:ou according to Warner (1937/58:44,45) is the name of the
language spoken by several groups of people. However it also functions as a name for
the overall group, which is composed of several hundred people. Within
Djambarrpuy1Ju there are numerous discriminations which serve to identify smaller
groups within the whole, yet at the same time there appears to be the notion of a
corporate identity as a single unit.

            The identification of what is meant by DjambarrpuY1Ju is further
complicated by the fact that the Yol:ou classify the distinctions between language
groups according to the word used for "this/here". Djambarrpuy:gu is just one of the
Dhuwalmirr (dhuwal-having) groups. Similarly GupapuY1Ju is just one of the groups
who speak Dhuwalarnirri (dhuwala -having). I have included a partial list of groups
and the languages that they speak according to Yol:ou classification in Figure 4.19, a
list compiled under the instructions of one elderly man at Galiwin'ku. In this figure it
will be noted that there are in fact two ways in which the YoI:ou classify languages
that are spoken. One of these is apparently used to classify clan dialects and
sometimes uses what is often referred to as the clan name for identification, the other,

based on the "this/here" classification links together sets of these groups and in
several cases crosscuts the moiety divisions. Frances Morphy (1983:2-5) discussing

the work of Zorc (1978) Schebeck ( 1968a and Heath ( 1978) whose lists are all

different from those given in the figure, concludes simply that "It is not possible given

the present state of knowledge, to subgroup these languages definitively".

              Having listed off all these groups as speaking the same language, although

as he said, separate dialects, he described distinctions between five different

Djambarrpuy:ou groups on the basis of particular named sites as shown in Table 4.1.


              Thus for him, to be DjambarrpuyIJu had two entirely different meanings.

Firstly to be Djambarrpuy:ou meant to be a member of one of the groups which speak

a language called by that name or even wider, to be a member of one of the groups

that speak one of the dhuwalmirrdialects. Secondly to be Djambarrpuy:ou could be to

be affiliated with one of the groups of sites in which Djambarrpuy:ou people have

particular interests. That is, Djambarrpuy:ou could mean either language or people and

again context is the main determiner. Of his two lists, it is of note that there are only

two groups that are named in both and one groups listed as Djambarrpuy:gu- !:iya-

gawumirr in the language list is implied to be not DjambarrpuyIJu in his land site

based list.


              On other occasions I have been quite different listings of Djambarrpuy:ou

groupings. One senior man said,

           There are three groups of DjambarrpuyIJu; NininyIJu Dhamarrandji, the
      main central Djambarrpuy:gu, Guyula or Marra-Dhalinymirr or Liya-dhalinymirr,
      andDhamarrwa:ga Dhamarrandji.


              It is of note that while two of his three groups were not named in the list

of land based groups (Table 4.1 ), his second group is described as two separate

groups in it. Another man, giving a series of names that relate to himself and his

father's group said that,

            Dhamarrandji is the same as Dhamarratjpi, also called Dhamarrarrwa:ga,
      and Nininy:ou Dhamarrandji and Waua-gundapuy mala. They relate to the ..... .
      spear of ...... , but you better not print its name.

             This listing of names identifies his clan with the second group in the first

man's list (they are both Gundapuy) and with the last one of the senior man's set of

three, but of more significance here is the emphasis on the multiple names of a single

group which identifies the group particularly in relation to a ritual object. A single clan

group may also have multiple ceremonial bases for their identity. Maratja, who is from

the Gundapuy Djambarrpuy:uu spoke of one aspect of it in this way,

              All our songs are from the sea and the shore, but they've given us the giltji
       (inland) songs. It was like this. Two old men went to Wagilak country. They
       were Djirrkigigi, my father's miiri'mu (paternal grandfather) and Gunbayalma,
       who was Golumala [clan]. They got songs from there. Maybe they traded miilka
       (a ritual string) or rariga (sacred object) then they got Wuyal so that makes us
       also Dhurili Djambarrpuy:uu which relates to Marra:uu. They are miiri (mother's
       mother's clan) and Golumala is number two miiri, (mother's mother's clan of
       slightly less significance).


             In this way his group has gained by exchange, a new set of relationships

which includes a new name series. 29

            Rarrkminy, from the same Gundapuy DjambarrpuyIJu group helped me

to establish a chart of the categories that were used to classify DjambarrpuyIJu groups

and in doing so started with the names of a number of the senior men, some of whom

were already deceased. Her categories were developed into the table shown in Figure

4.20. It demonstrates that senior women have a considerable knowledge of what is

supposed to be men's business.30 In the table there is no use of the word "mala"
discussed earlier. The column headed Biipurru contains what are probably the nearest
equivalents to a clan name.31 The heading Wava (place) refers to the geographic type
of the general location of the site associated with a major sacred item. Wava Yiiku
(place name) is in this table, the name of the major area owned by the group. Magayin
(sacred item) is the general name for the group's major sacred item, and Bundurris
one name given to the set of special names associated with the magayin that are part of
the group's identity. Note that this is not a comprehensive list ofDjambarrpu}'Uu
groups. At a later time, in an attempt to clarify the distinctions between the different
Djambarrpuygu groups, Maratja listed them off for me with basic information that
was intended to describe the major features of the identity of each group. In this he
named nine groups as shown in Table 4.2

              In the main all groups (biipurru) are related to all other groups through
relationships established through some religious property held in common by them,
whether this be land or some other element such as song, myth, dance, design, or
three dimensional objects used in rituals.There are on the basis of such shared
interests in religious properties, a wide range of what might be called meta-groupings
of clans. Such groupings overlap with each other to such an extent that a biipurru
(clan) group may belong to a number of such meta-groupings with a different
association of clans in each. They may be named or they may simply be identified as
"those who share '.... .' with us."

              Warner (1958:37), labelling these meta-groupings as "phratries", appears
to have dismissed them as "a weak attempt within the culture to create new and larger
groups than the clan to control the intra-moiety antagonisms". While they do have
some role in this, it appears that the main purposes of such sharing of religious

recording.

property is to establish relationships which bring with them the potential for obtaining

wives, and thus the maintenance/continuance of the individual's magayin
(sacredness)and almost incidently some potential for increased harmony between the
groups.

            Within this complexity of clans and moiety specific clan groupings, every
marriage brings with it a set of cross-moiety interclan affiliations, and when a man
marries women from more than one group, his children by different wives then have
different sets of affiliations. To again quote Da:gataija,
             There is a difference between my side of the family and (my brother)
      Dji.niyini's side. We had one father, but two different mothers. My miiri [clans in
      relationship of mother's mothers] are Djapu, Djambarrpu)'Uu, Liya-gawumirr,
      and Dapwuy because my mother came from them. My close miiri are
      Djambarrpu}'UU (close ma.Qayin) because miiri married both. Dji!!iyin.i's mother
      came from Rirratj~u. Da!iwuy, Djambarrpu}'Uu and rjaymil. Rirratjiuu and
      Da!iwuy are close miiri for him. rjaymil fits in but not close because old lady
      came from Rirratji:gu and Da!iwuy and rjaymil.

            Through just such situations as this one described by Da:gataija, that is, the
marrying of women with different connections there comes the potential for a small
clan to expand and increase its relationships within the wider community. Contained
also within this is the foundation by which larger clan may divide and become two
separate clans. In the preceding section of this chapter, one aspect of the network of
relations of a smaller clan has been described by Da:gata:ga for the Golumala through
his use of the yam plant as an image. In this it was shown that there are a group of
clans which shared the yam as a sacred object. On the basis of this they saw
themselves as being an intermarrying group who, in theory at least, give their
daughters to be mothers of wives for other clans in the group. In fact there are two
groups involved in this. One of these, the Gapiny group, is made up of the Dii!iwuy,
rjaymil and Golumala clans, and this group is then embedded within a larger group
for which I recorded no name, but which also includes the Djapu clan.




                                               174

            When the Morning Star is used as a basis for relationships, Rirratjiuu,

Galpu and Murru:uun-Gunbirri are included with the above four to form yet another

grouping. In an entirely different set of relationships based on a different set of

ceremonial exchanges Golumala form a group with Marra:uu, Wawilak and a small

group ofDjambarrpuy:uu people. This group is called Dhurili mala (group), a name

which I was told indicates that they share together the mokuy (spirit being) named

Wurray.


            In this same way each different ceremonial item shared by Golumala with

other clans forms the basis for a different set of relationships. Many of these overlap

so that Golumala may have a relationship with any one other clan on a number of

different bases, but it appears that no other clan shares with them all the same items.If

this state of affairs did arise, the integrity of the group would be compromised. That

is, if two clans shared all the same items there would be no way for either clan to

declare their identity to be unique.


            The result of the development of all these separate meta-groupings, each

formed on the basis of a shared religious element, is that each clan is embedded within

an extremely complex network of relationships. Each relationship brings with it both

obligations and privileges. The obligations are economic, political, social and

religious, involving the assistance from a clan to one's own advantage in all those

spheres in preference to another clan to which less obligation is owed. Privileges take

the form of being able to activate such obligations to one's own advantage. In this

subtle and sometimes not so subtle environment of constant struggle for advantage,

the wisdom of the elderly who have the knowledge of the privileges and obligations

and how to manage them, is highly valued.

            CONCLUSION.

            In this chapter I have shown how the relationships are structured between

individuals, between families and groups and between these and natural species,
entities associated with the inside of reality, the natural elements and in particular
locations with the earth itself. The personal cosmos is then like a living organism in
which the individual Yoliju finds himself or herself suspended in a multi-dimensional
network of relationships.

            This human cosmos is not static, but constantly in flux. Relationships are
continuously in the process of adaptation, extension or contraction, cancellation or
establishment. Throughout these processes, the tools of maintenance and of change, of
advantage and manipulation are also seen to be both pragmatic and religious. They
include control over both the reproductive capacity of women and over powerful
religious elements.

            While the relationships are in a constant state of flux, yet it is possible for
the Yoliju to interpret these as representing ongoing transformations in outward
appearance of a cosmos that is unchanging and in which all things are in a fixed and
pennanent relation to all other things. Thus in the human process of interrelating it is
possible to perceive an ideal in which a person's unchanging identity is gradually
discovered, through a process of revelation. Hypothetically at least, human relations
are worked out and marriages arranged on the basis of a pre-fixed order and inherited
relations. Yet because of the multiplicity of interweaving strands in the networks of
relationships, such marriages are an ongoing cause of contention and manouvering.
Each party involved being able to justify their position on a different aspect of the
"eternally fixed" order of relationships. Once an arrangement has been established and
accepted no matter how "wrong" it may be according to some, it will be interpreted
over time in such a way that it is seen to be in accordance with the unchanging reality
and as a result, the unchanging nature of reality is further reinforced.

            RELATIONSHIPS WITH SPACE.
            INTRODUCTION.

            In the examination of Yo~u understandings of space there are

four primary assumptions which stand out as affecting most discussions.
These are, first that identity is based on focus, and not on delimitation,
second that the land is a physical space, third that the land is also a non-
physical space, and fourth that the Yo~u and the land are in living, dynamic
relationship with each other. In this chapter I demonstrate the fundamental
relationship between these four assumptions and Yo~u perceptions of space
through a consideration of a number of distinct domains of thought. These
include techniques used to identify spaces and locate elements in space,
perceptions of various different levels of geographic space and ideas of
relationship and identity.

            The chapter is divided into two main sections. I consider first the
conceptual areas which are associated with the identification and
classification of physical space, together with ideas oflocation, distance and
direction in that space. The second section of the chapter then looks at human
relations with space. Here space is discussed in relation to a person's identity
in general terms, then different dimensions of space are examined in

succession to see how this affects human relations. In doing this, I start with
Elcho Island as a whole, with the various methods by which a tract of land
gains its identity and is identified, and with the differences between
ownership and rights. Then one area on the south-western comer of Elcho
Island named Dhambal3-0ur is considered, as an example of a sacred site, of
the ways in which religious and mythological significance is attributed to
such sites, and of attitudes towards such significance. This illustrates a way




                                               177
                                       Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.


of thinking about the land and its sacredness as a manifestation of the inner

or spiritual side of reality.


             Galiwin 'ku township is discussed as a background to

demonstrating some of the ways in which the various clans represented in

the town declare, and attempt to manipulate, their rights to be part of the

community and to be considered in the distribution of community assets such

as housing. Finally consideration is given to the ways Yoluu perceive and

relate to space beyond Arnhem Land, from Australia to the rest of the earth,

and beyond this planet to celestial space.


   CONCEPTUALISATION OF SPACE.

      The Relationship between Focus and Boundary.

             The concept of focus, introduced in Chapter 1, and already

shown to be important in the understanding of identity, is critical to the

understanding of the Yoluu perception of space. It is in the identification of

spaces and the ownership of spaces that the notion offocus highlights the

differences between the YollJu and Western approaches. In a Western

understanding of area, space or land, there is the presupposition that what is

being considered is defined by delimitation. That is, that a definite boundary

exists. Definition of area, space or land requires such delimitation, and this

cannot be done without establishing boundaries.


             The result of this Western perception is that we have, in the

literature concerning Aborigines, a stream of statements concerning known

boundaries. For example, Spencer (1921:LXIII quoted in Dixon 1976:233)

           A tribe is ...... regarded as owning a definite tract of country, the
      boundaries of which are known to them and recognised by the
      members of other tribes.




                                             178
                                       Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.

            Elkin (1938n0:56), while speaking of boundaries does however
brings out the point that there are not always easily defined boundaries
suggesting that,
            tribal boundaries are usually clearly defined by natural features;
      sometimes there is a kind of no-man's land between the two tribes, and
      occasionally it is difficult to know to which tribe certain territory
      belongs, for the simple reason that it is of little value or interest so no
      one cares.

            Tindale ( 1976:12-29) argues that not only did boundaries exist,
between tribal groups, but that they were for the most part ecologically
based. In his study he gives evidence that some boundaries can also be
established around those areas which need specialised knowledge to exploit
their resources. However it can also be argued that many, if not all of the
boundaries he describes could be considered as places at the edge of
significance for exploitation or of no significance to groups and which can
then also be described in European terms as a boundary.

            Keen (1978:48) speaks of an alternative set of reasons (other
than irrelevancy) for people not going beyond the limits of their familiar
territory. He indicates such things as the possibility of dangerous places,
places that may cause sickness, unknown spiritual entities and the knowledge
that some places have dangerous power because of ancestral beings and that,
             Because of all these dangers and restrictions people will not stay
      in a strange country without friends to guide them, unless forced to do
      so. This means in effect that people only use the country of clans to
      which they are closely related, or of which they possess knowledge for
      other reasons.


            These kinds of things then, form a type of limitation, not so
much because there is a fixed delimitation of space, but because of having
passed beyond familiar focal places and the possible proximity of non-
familiar and hence potentially dangerous places, which are best avoided. This
idea of a boundary being able to be established where you are entering
another tribe's territory is similar to that spoken of by Tindale.

                                               179
                                          Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.

              While the literature includes descriptions of boundaries of tribal

areas which relate to changes in landfonn, soil or vegetation type (e.g.

Tindale 1976, Peterson 1976, Mulvaney 1976, Flood 1976 and Williams

1986), there are also references to the normal irrelevance of boundaries and

to the difficulty of establishing them.


              Peterson ( 1971:225-7) has suggested that the Yolgu from

Mirrgatja do have the concept of boundary although he found it difficult to

get them defined. However the concept he defines appears to be more one of

exclusion or restriction in relation to significant sites than the actual marking

of a boundary and appears to be relative rather than fixed. He says (p226)

that,

               Pan of the reason for boundaries being ill defined is that they are
        of no importance in daily life. However the closer they pass to areas of
        ritual importance the better defined they become until the point is
        reached where they would meet the approval of a surveyor as at the
        Bidingal clan well. It is of interest that the Gidjingali boundary is at a
        point where it is implied, two ancestral heroes met, and therefore a
        place that may be of ritual importance ·


              Thus the one boundary he records as absolutely fixed is actually

a separation between two clan's focal places which are side by side. In his

description this idea of separation by restriction rather than by fixed

boundary becomes clearer when he suggests (p226) that, "The nearest to a

specific tenn for boundary is lolo." He says that this word is used as the

name for the resonating tin can or piece of bark put around the opening of a

didgeridoo and also for European fences. He quotes Mrs N.Williams as

supplying infonnation that it is used also at a makarata peace making

ceremony for the "closed circle of men that gathered around the murderer at

the conclusion of the ceremony," where it also referred "to the ritual/legal




                                                180
                                       Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.


circumscriptions on the man". He reports that when the circle opened, the

man was physically, legally and ritually free, whether he was stabbed in the

thigh by an offended relative or not


            The word suggested here by Peterson is also the word used by

the Y o~u for gaol, and the name for and intertidal stone fish trap which

restricts the escape of fish, making them easy to spear. In this use and in each

of the uses he described, it would appear to refer to "restriction" (from or

within) a meaning that partly overlaps the parameters of the meanings of the

English word "boundary" but which is not exactly the same.


            From his report, the nearest Peterson could find to a concept of

boundary was this concept of restriction. There is in his report no clear

evidence that anything like the Western notion of boundary existed in the

Yoluu approach to space and its use. Although as Keen (1978:47) says,

             Some boundaries are clearly defined, such as the edge of a forest
      or the division between saltflat and grassplain. Other boundaries are
      less precise - perhaps just an imaginary line between two trees.
      Sometimes there is no defined boundary, simply one side of a forest is
      one 'place', and the other side is another. One type of terrain tends to
      predominate at each 'big-name' place, although many contain a mixed
      ecology.


            My own experience in mapping areas with Yo~u informants is

that it is often a major effort to establish anything like a boundary, even

between sites belonging to different moieties unless the site has a natural

physical limit such as the bank of a river or the edge of a jungle. However

even in these cases it is the river or the jungle which is of importance, not its

edge. My observations appear also to agree exactly with those made by Hiatt.

He records (1962:65, and 66) that among the Gidjingali (western neighbours

of the Yo~u) he found the same process of naming sites, with the absence of

boundaries except where these coincided with a natural feature, apparently by

coincidence as much as design, but supported to some degree by mythology.


                                          181
                                             Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.



              My argument is not that boundaries cannot be established, but

that the mode of establishing ownership, or which territory is owned, was

not by boundary but by focus and that therefore any boundary involved was

incidental not critical. It is proximity to sites of significance that is important,

and who owned them, not who controlled the periphery or the less

significant land at a distance from them. It is as Berndt ( 1976:134) reports

for Western Desert people concerning the identification of sites, that as one

moves from one site to the next,

              the actual site name is expanded to blur with the next so that the
       country immediately surrounding any one site becomes identified with
       it. No clear-cut boundaries are recognised.


              The "boundaries" recorded by Tindale and others are, according

to this approach, established at what might be called the place of greatest

irrelevance, beyond which there is "no value to us", using the term "value"

from a Yoluu perspective where value is seen in terms of intensity of

relationship to the focus (see Figure 5.1 )1. That is, boundary is positioned at

a place "beyond our place of value" in a ceremonial sense, and nearer to

some other's place of value. Such "boundaries" as are applied to land are all

related to ownership of ritually or spiritually significant places. While they

serve to establish or rather reinforce rights in these places, they are not meant

to exclude all other people. Williams (1986:83) has said that,

             boundaries are, in general, only as precise as they need to be and
       they may be precise or imprecise for a number of reasons.


              Nancy Williams argues however (1982 and 1986) that the Yoluu

at Yirrkala can and do demarcate precise boundaries when under pressure of

one kind or another to delineate ownership of particular sites. In the terms of

her description these reasons can be summed up as being in direct proportion

to the closeness of relationships between adjacent land owning groups with

more precise boundaries2 reflecting poorer relations.

              My suggestion is that it is not the normal practice to place any
emphasis on demarcation except for political reasons of one kind or another,
and that then if the dispute is between two groups, each will claim, and
support with a variety of arguments, that the "boundary" is established in
their favour. This is not an argument based so much on the movement of or
establishment of boundaries, as an argument based on the establishment of
relative significance and power of rival groups and their perceptions of their
own importance and the relative importance of the sites. In my own
observations, such claims appear to be more regularly voiced in the presence
of non-competitors, in an attempt to build support for one's own claims.

perimeter.

             Where two groups have pressure put on them by an outside
body, e.g. a government agency, to establish a "boundary" between their
adjacent territories, this will be established as an expression of the relations
between them, and afterwards ignored except in a dispute situation. This type
of response is to be expected because it is the named site, and often a
particular point within the named site which is significant. The surrounding
named area then functions as a buffer around and an extension of that which
is important. 3

             This system works for the YolIJu; however they have discovered
that in relations with the white man it doesn't and they have to translate their
system to match his system to obtain satisfactory results in relation to him. A
perfect example of the failure to appreciate the difference between the YolIJu
and Western approaches to identifying land is found in a sacred banyan tree
that once was surrounded by jungle at the site of the Nabalco mine at Gove.
The tree was designated as the sacred site and it was not argued that the
jungle around it was important to it and part of the site. Therefore the mining
company removed the surrounding jungle and at the last observation I made,
the company was daily watering an isolated tree in the middle of a mining
area. The YolIJu in the Yirrkala area will not make that same mistake twice.

             This Gove example gives an appreciation of the need for Yirrkala
Yoll)u to establish very precise boundaries against the incursions of white
miners at Gove. As a result of having their land under threat the Yirrkala
people have become very articulate and well able to give precise boundaries
to land, using in almost all the examples that Williams lists, some natural
physical variation as an indication of a given boundary.


3 Unlike the Western concept where a piece of land defined by its boundary is generally
thought of as all being of the same value.

      Classifications of Space and the Naming of Sites.

            The most obvious basis for the naming of geographic features of

the land is the projection onto it of an anthropomorphic image. This results in

the folowing list of terms for body parts being also terms for landscape

features.

            buku = forehead, headland.
            mariutji =eye, small waterhole,
            vurru = nose, point
            dhurrwara = mouth, river mouth
            dhakal = cheek or island,
            mayari = throat, creek or river,
            ffeltji =back, the bush, back or hinterland country. Made up of
                   open eucalyptus forest,
            gulun = stomach, large water hole or swamp,
            Jilcan =elbow, river bend.
            makarr-yindi =thigh-big, the mainland as contrasted to coastal
                   islands,


            Other ecological zones which are also distinguished but which

have no apparent relation to body parts are

            Jantha I gathuf =mangrove areas,
            Qinydjiya = tidal plain or salt pan,
            ravi I dhawaga = sand, beach or exposed sand bar,
            retja =variously described as jungle or monsoon forest
            moQuk =literally salt, the sea or salt water,
            djiwarr' =the heavens, heaven, the sky or simply the above.

            These two lists contain the major terms used to identify

geographic features. Figure 5. 2. is drawn as a stylised landscape to make the

anthropomorphic features of some of these terms more easily visible. As

none of the terms in the second list are also used for body parts it cannot be

suggested that the landscape is seen simply from an anthropomorphic

perspective.


               Those terms for the landscape features which are

anthropomorphic have some distinct advantages when mythological

interpretations are being applied to such aspects of the land. This can easily

be recognised when we take as an example the shark site in the Wessel

Islands which was partially described earlier in Chapter 2. At the south-

eastern tip of Martjanba Island in the Wessels there is a bay that is several

kilometres across (See Map 2.1). Approaching it across land from the West

you come to the edge of a cliff that is fifty or sixty metres high and can look

down on the whole panorama of the bay. A sandy beach swings away at first

to the North-east and then in a long curve towards the South-east till it meets

a long hill that juts out into the sea. Something like the bay drawn in Figure

2.2.


              This entire site represented the transformation of the ancestral

shark and particular features of the landscape were pointed out as parts of the

shark's body. However without the knowledge that this is a shark site, one

could hear a discussion of at least some of the landscape features, hear the

normal reference to body part names, but not know that the discussion had

nothing to do with the landscape.4


              With the use of anthropomorphic projection onto the landscape, it

would be possible with this site for a man to paint a picture of the shark as an

ordinary shark, to be symbolically encoding a layer of meaning which talks
about the sacred shark object or raI,Jga, and still another representing features

of the landscape that were associated with the shark ancestor.5 The advantage

of using the anthropomorphic projection is then that the encoded meanings

are able to be kept secret from those one desires to be kept in ignorance. 6



4 In this case, the use of the normal body part tenns for the landscape features enables
reference to be made to the body parts of the ancesttal being without revealing the
additional meanings to the uninitiated.
5 Morphy (1983:123) in his description of~ paintings from Djarrakpi
demonstrates that notions of anthropomotphic features of the landscape are also found
there in paintings representing the landscape in one level of interpretation.
6 It could be argued that this is an example of zoomorphic projection, but the principle is
the same.

              A totally different aspect of the naming of locations is that

associated with the development of the names for particular places. Many

places gain their names as a result of being named after some mythological or

historical event. In a later section dealing with Dhambalauur I will show that

it was on these bases that a number of the sites were named.7


              Within the town of Galiwin 'ku, there are a number of sites

named on the basis of mythology, such as :t;f alkan:gur, the hospital site

associated with the Barracoota, and Damala Yalu (lit.eagle's nest) next to it,

where the water tanks now stand, where eagles reputedly nested in tall

stringybark trees, but which also has mythological associations.


              Many of the sites on the Elcho coastline (See Map 5.4.) have

gained their names as a result of such mythological events. Some have

alternative names which describe some aspect of the location. For example,

the short beach at the end of the airstrip, which has a mythologically based

name, Gurrka-walpa (lit. penis- ? ) is commonly called Munatha gurriri

(lit.sand short) or Munatha dhumbul (lit. sand short). There are also some

sites which have been named as a result of a simple feature at the site such as

at Riyalauur (lit.stream-at) the site of the freshwater spring which was the

source of the town's water supply until the late 1960s, and N a.rrarri:uur (lit.

Wild apple tree-at) which refers to the most south-easterly residential area,

where the first Yol:gu cottages were built near a !1.arran.i8 tree.


              Finally there are in the town at least two sites named on a

historical basis. Djalumbu:gur is the open area between the two W arramiri



1 For example, there is the rock and surrounding area called~atili nhinan (liL black cockatoo
sat) where m mythological times the black cocKatoo is reputeC:l to have landed. The black
cockatoo is associated with one of the sacred objects for the area so this site name also has
~tential for more than one interpretation.

areas, named because a Djalumbu (hollow log coffm) used to stand there.
Wulma.our (lit. thunder-at) sounds like a myth-based name, but it was given
because it is the place where the DjambarrpuYl)u Guyula live, and in
particular where a senior ceremonial leader from the clan lived. Thunder
being a major ceremonial element for that clan, they are identified by the
name and from that so is the site. It could be said of both of these that while
they are historically based there are also mythological links.

            From this examination of the naming of sites it is possible to
draw out what appears to be a simple set of principles by which such names
are given. That is names are given on the basis of, anthropomorphic
projection, mythological or historical events or associations (difficult to
separate) and recognisable features, but they do not appear to be given the
personal names of humans.

      Distance,      Locatio~      and Direction in Space.

            The location of any object, person or event in space is indicated
using a variety of methods, however it should be noted that in each of them
the Yo~u identify a specific location in space in terms of its relation to other

locations, they do not measure the distance between locations. In addition to
this, there are a number of other ways of indicating relationship to space.
There are noun suffixes that indicate direction or location in relation to the
noun, there is a set of deictic pronouns which identify relative proximity, and
there are wind directions which are used for a variety of purposes. Each of

these is outlined below.

            Lowe (n.d.) lists a number of words which she describes as
"pure adverbs of place"; (p.11), djinaga (inside), WarFa1Jul (outside), barrku
(far away), galki (close by) and garrwar(above/up top). Each of these




                                              189
                                        Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.

classifications is modified using one of the terms, mlirr (moderately) or
mirithirri (intensely) to produce a series of three evaluations in each category.
For example, miirr barrku (moderately far away), barrku (far away) and
mirithirr barrku (extremely far away), can be used to classify the locations of
items that are not close.

            In any use of these terms, the classification made is in relation to

the context of that use. Because the context of use is variable, the meaning of
each of the three terms in a set is relative, to each other term, and also to the
context of its use. Each set of three terms describes a discrete quality or
attribute of existence, and each is seen as being in relationship to its opposite,
but as not forming part of a continuum with its opposite term. For example
galld (close) and barrku (far away) used as evaluations oflocation in a more

or less horizontal plane, are seen not as poles of a continuum, but as
classificatorily distinct categories between which there is no continuum. They
are also the terms which come nearest to any indication of distance from
some location.

            In addition to such terms for generalised location in space relative
to the speaker, there are three suffixes which enable location or direction to
be specified relative to any particular item or named place. These give yet
another way of describing the location or movement of any person, animal or
thing. For example, a person who is at or was at the ra.gi (beach) would be
described in Gupapuy:gu as riqJi.gura (raui beach, -.oura at, in, by). Someone

moving towards it is going raf)ilili (-lili, towards) and if going away from it
they are going rau4Juru (-.guru, from, away from).

            While there are a number of deictic pronouns listed in Lowe
(n.d.) there are only four discrete locations identified by them. These

of nearness and farness, indicate two pairs of opposed terms with each term
in a pair opposed to the other. All the locations are relative to each other, and
each is relative to the speaker's position. They can be summarised as a pair
of terms referring to locations that are relatively close to the speaker and a
pair that refer to relatively distant locations. With the close ones there is
constrast between whether a location is within reach of the speaker (or closer
to the speaker than to the listener) and out of reach of the speaker (or closer

to the listener). With the pronouns that refer to more distant locations there
appears to be a contrast between locations that are either within sight (or at
least closer than the horizon) and locations that are further away.

              Directions are also given in what are commonly interpreted as
"compass directions''9, but which appear to refer to the direction from which
named winds blow at known times of the year.10 The set of terms used for
this can apparently be used to indicate the direction of movement to or from
given locations, as well as in relation to a speaker. They are used to describe
the direction of a particular location (with the appropriate locational or
directional suffix added), or the directions from which the wind is coming.

       Land and Identity

              The land and the surrounding seas of the North East Arnhem
Land region form the space in which the YoJ.uu live. As Bagaltja said
(1980: 10) the
              "Land is a breathing place for the Yol:ou people."

             That is, the land is where life exists, for the acts of moving and
breathing (according to Yol:ou classifications) distinguish those things that
are alive from those that are not 12 Thus the land is also the place in which
man's physical or outside manifestation exists. However, the land is far more
to the YoJ.uu than a breathing place. Djigiyini Gondarra (1980:8) describes a
much closer relationship; that of actual kinship.
            "The land is my mother. Like a human mother, the land gives us
      protection, enjoyment, and provides for our needs - economic, social
      and religious. We have a human relationship with the land: Mother-
      daughter, son. When the land is taken from us or destroyed, we feel
      hurt because we belong to the land and we are part of it."

             Such human kinship relationships are part of the normal Yol:ou
approach to land. As I have shown in Chapter 4, areas of land are seen to
give women to be mothers for the children of other pieces of land. As a
result of this a person is able to refer to himself as being in a kinship
relationship to a number of sites. Thus the site that his mother came from is
his fPi!l.di (mother) and the site that her mother came from is ma.ti (mother's

mother) to him. Major sites are thus also seen as being in a permanent kin

relationship to each other. This relationship between sites can be represented

as in Map 5.1. where the site at the source of each arrow is seen as being the

mother for the site at its point. The site from which a man's father comes and

hence also the site from which he comes, could be, but is not referred to as

his father. Rather it is called his homeland or Yirralka. (See Map 5.2.).


            Djalaugi, in a very brief statement encapsulates the significance

to the Yoluu of their homelands, when he says,

             "Homeland is called yirralka. Identity comes from there. Yirralka
      tells you that you are Yoluu. Without it you can't be Yoluu. Manikay
      (song cycle) at yirralka is special and helps you know what you are."

             "Some magayin wii1}a (sacred places), you can go there and you
      can get sick, but some are good places so long as you don't cut trees. A
      long time ago Raymaugirr was know as a place for boils, and when
      balanda (white men) were cutting poles for the wharf there, they all got
      boils. I only heard that story. It was when Sheppie was at Milingimbi."


            The homeland is the focus of both the individual's and the clan's

identity. The magayin, the sacred elements of the clan's identity, are

predominantly related to the yirralka, 13 and it is to the yirralka that at least

some element of the deceased clan member is believed to return. It is a place

that must be treated with the most absolute respect, and it is considered

dangerous not to do so. An example of this danger is included in the quote,

where it is emphasised that not even the white man could avoid the

dangerous power there as evidenced by the boils that were seen to occur

when they cut down trees at the Marrauu clan's homeland site at Raymaugirr.


             A person's identity cannot be fully explained except in terms of

his relationship to the land and to particular parts of the land. This

relationship is expressed in terms of the individual's identification with

sacred objects, designs and paintings which function as proof of the

relationships between the person, the site and the actions of the foundational

ancestors at the particular site as they moved from place to place through the

region.


             The homeland centre is just that, the centre of a tract of land

which is the spiritual homeland for a patrilineal clan. It is the focus of the

sections of mythology, which link it to many if not all of the other sites in a

clan's territory. As such it is the focus also of the identity of the whole tract

of land. Some clans have a number of such centres in a single region, some

have only a single major site in theirs. Still others have two or more major

sites with their associated territories scattered in different parts of Arnhem

Land. I could find no consistent pattern which would explain all these

variations and there is no certainty that all the major sites of any one clan will

be linked by the activities of a single creative being or ancestor. Many,

though not all of the major clan territories match the river basins that line the

coast.14 Where this is so it is the river which is the focus of the territory's

identity and not a boundary between it and the next river. Some major

territories have no significant rivers at all, but it would appear that in every

case a permanent fresh water source, if not being the central focus of the

area, is closely related to it


             These yi.rralka, as far as record and mythology show, have

always been the central fact of the clan's identity, but until quite recent

historical times appear to have not been permanent places of residence. With

the arrival of missionaries, attempts were made to teach the Y o~u to grow

food crops such as sweet potato, cassava, some other vegetables and fruit



14 See Peterson 1974.

trees. The idea behind this appears to have been to encourage people not to

leave their land for the mission towns and at the same time to introduce what

were then thought to be the skills and understandings needed for a civilised

life. To do this the Yo~u were encouraged to develop "outstations" on their

own country. According to Shepherdson (1981), "The first outstation in

Arnhem Land was established in 1936 at Gattji on the mainland ten miles

south of Milingimbi". This appears to be the first recorded attempt of one of

the Yo~u establishing a permanent settlement on his own homeland. Other

such "outstations" were slowly established in the eastern half of Arnhem

Land. Right from the beginning the idea developed and was encouraged by

Harold Shepherdson, that if an airstrip was cut and cleared, it was possible to

get the desired Western items in exchange for such items as crocodile skins,

and still remain in their own country .15 When the export of such skins was

banned the only alternative became the development of the craft industry.


             From the mid 1960s, a wave of newer settlements, 16 began to be

developed, as mining interests appeared on the scene and the land itself came

under threat. As much to protect their homeland centres from attack as for

any other reason, people began to establish permanent homes there. Those

that I was able to identify with some degree of accuracy are shown on the

map and the ones serviced from Elcho are listed in Table 5.2 17, together with

the relationship between clan ownership, the leader of each centre, and the

land it is on. When this is examined, it is found that eighteen are on their own
country, three are on f}iindi (mother's) country, four are on marl (mother's

mother's) country, two are on country for which their clan is

mother and one is on country which has the same magayin (sacred objects)
as his own. Finally there is one Thursday Island man who has settled with
his wife on her country, making it his children's mother's country. While
only one of the eighteen listed above as settling on their own country could
be considered as an "old" man, none of the others are young men. In all

cases the leader for the centre is close kin for the land. I did not have
opportunity to investigate further reasons for the ten who were developing
centres to which they were related through their matriline, but there does
seem to be good support for Peterson's suggestion in general statistical terms
(1974:24) that there is a,

             cultural value that makes adult men increasingly keen to live on
      their own clan estate, not only because they are always at hand to
      participate in their own clan ceremonies, but because they wish to die
      there.

             At Galiwin'ku there are however some elderly and very senior
men who have chosen to live in the town itself. In the majority of cases, this
is for medical reasons. Most of them are on continuous treatment through
the local hospital and it would appear that for most of them the assurance of
treatment and of staying alive is an even greater motivation than the attraction
of the homeland.18 One very senior man from the Liya-gawumirr clan had
tried to live on his homeland, but nearly died of a severe asthma attack. As a
result he chose to stay where he could get prompt medical attention. If such
facilities were available at their homelands, there is little doubt that that is
where the majority would prefer to be living. There is a strong motivation to
protect the country from the intrusion of white men (particularly miners) to
protect the particular lineage's claim to the site and the ownership of the
magayin (sacred elements) that belong there. Each centre functions as I have

indicated above, as the focus of the identity of the geographic region, but also

at a different level as the focus of identity of the owning clans and

individuals.


             The YollJu mythology features innumerable journeys by what

appear to be ancestors or ancestral beings from one homeland centre to

another.19 The number of stories and variations of stories appears to be

endless. As has been shown some of the beings are considered to be offar

greater significance than others, and there is a correlation between the

importance of any one being and the number of different clans and clan

territories linked by that being's journeys.


               The journeys and actions of these ancestral beings are treated as

the basis for the relationships which exist between the sites and hence the

clans. The two moieties have completely separate sets of beings, each

ancestor being careful to travel only in country of the same moiety as itself.

Where a myth describes the passage from one area to the next it may be

described as going inside in one and coming out in the next, as going over or

under, but not carrying out any actions on land which is of the opposite

moiety.20


               I have made an attempt to outline the journeys of some of the

ancestral beings on the map ofYoluu territory (see Map 5.3). This is simply

to illustrate the ways in which their journeys link the major homeland

centres of the different clans. While it is only a minute sample it shows that a

network of linked sites is formed which mirrors the relationships established




19 At this point I am only concerned with the networking of their journeys across the
landsc~ having discusSed the natme of the beings more fully and outlined the three major
~in Chapter2.
  Berndt, Keen, Morphy and Warner and others record such details.


                                                201

between the clans who own those sites. In every case, the concepts involved

are of interlinked focal places, rather than of connected, bounded territories.

              Because of the interweaving of these journeys. each major site

can be seen as linked with a wide range of ancestral beings. Through this the

sites form the focus of two separate aspects of the clan's and hence the

individual's identity. First there are the outward links to other clans that form

part of their identity as members of the wider Yol:ou community. Secondly

the unique combination of ancestors and their activities at any one clan's set

of sites provides means for distinguishing the discrete nature of the

associated clan's identity from all other clans. 21


       Elcho Island.

              Elcho Island is spoken of by the Yol:ou as a kind of midway

place between the people who live to the east and those who live to the west.

The island itself. roughly 65 kilometres long and from 3 to 12 km wide. lies

in a string of islands in a generally north east to south west direction, being at

its closest point approximately two kilometres from the mainland.


              Ecologically. apart from the complete absence of any significant

elevation, the island can be thought of as representative of Arnhem Land

generally22. The basic cover over the land is open Eucalyptus forest. broken

by intermittent dry rainforest. The eastern coastline is dominated by an

almost continuous mangrove fringe broken only by an occasional short

beach. The western coastline is predominantly a series of sandy beaches

separated by low rocky headlands and a series of tidal creeks supporting




21 As I have shown in Chapter 4
22 This generalisation does not take into consideration the vast Arafura swamp region
described by Peterson (1971). The other features described here while not including any
major rivers, are repeated consistently right around the Arnhem Land coast.

          beings.

mangrove areas. Along the island there are occasional swampy areas, some

of which are supported by relatively permanent fresh water. The best original

source of permanent fresh water was the spring at the base of the cliffs

where the mission settlement was established. This has now been replaced

by a permanent supply of good bore water and a programme has been

established to sink bores at all the homeland centres.


            The island is classified into sections ofland (including the

adjacent sea ) which belong to one or the other of the two named moieties. If

a continuous journey is made around the coastline, it is discovered that most,

features are named with territory adjacent to each being given the same name

as the feature. This is so whether the feature is a rock, a waterhole, a sand

dune, beach or river, so there is no relationship between the sizes of different

named areas apart from the size of the feature from which the area is named.


            If the hypothetical journey along the coast continues, eventually

the last named site belonging to one moiety (for example Yirritja) is reached.

The next set of sites will belong to the Dhuwa moiety. When the last of these

Dhuwa sites has been reached, the next site will then be Yirritja again. This

alternation of groups of sites belonging to opposite moieties continues right

round the coastline until the original starting place has been reached.


            Periodically there is a brief intrusion of an isolated site or two

belonging to the opposite moiety where some mythological incident occurred

due to the actions of an ancestor or ancestral being of the same moiety as the

intrusive site. In following this process around different sections of Elcho

Island I have only found clear boundaries where the named feature has a

natural limit to its extension, such as the edge of a named "jungle" (the local

name for a section of dry rainforest). Even then it is normal for large tracts of

adjacent open Eucalyptus forest of indeterminate area to be given the same

name as the nearest precisely named area whether that be a rock, a jungle, a

swampy area or even a long beach. This agrees with the notions of focus

outlined earlier in this chapter. Map 5.4, illustrates the major moiety divisions

of the land on Elcho Island. The "boundaries" drawn on the map are simply

lines drawn between the last named sites of each moiety, or drawn around

groups of sites belonging to one moiety, and should not be considered as

precise edges.


             Of the larger areas, some are undisputedly acknowledged as

belonging to a single group. For other areas, different informants give

different responses as to who are the owning groups. Some are "owned" by

groups of clans, with the priority of ownership disputed, some are argued to

be in the process of being "looked after" by one group or another, and there

is one area, for which the clan has died out and one man has been

acknowledged as "owning" it on the basis that his father discovered him as

dugong at that site before conception.23


             Berndt (197 6) published a map of Elcho drawn from sketches

made by Elcho men in 1968 which as he says were not drawn to scale. Some

very interesting points become apparent when this map is compared with my

own records shown in Map 5.4. 24 Firstly there are some sections of

Berndt's map which are recorded in great detail with an expansive use of map

space,25 while others were skimmed over with minimum detail. However,

while there is general agreement between the two maps as far as the

allocation of sites to moieties is concerned, there is one Dhuwa section of the

coastline which was completely omitted on the map drawn for Berndt



23 See Rrurrambu's story of his coming to his father in Chapter 3.

              The very full description given to some sections of the coast

would appear to indicate that the original artists were focussing on land in

which they were asserting rights and to which they were giving

importance. 26


              Finally there are some major sections of the south east coast27

where there appears to be a difference among the YolJJu as to which sites

belong to which moieties (especially the Berndt sites 125-136). There is a

difference between the moiety attributions recorded in 1968 and in 1990 for

some of the sites. There are also some sites along this stretch of coast which

were said by some of my informants to be Dhuwa while others said they

were Yirritja. Whether this confusion arose from poor recording or poor

communication, or whether there actually is a disagreement amongst the

Yol:ou over the ownership of these sites, I am not currently able to discern.


              There is a distinction made between those who have ownership

of sites and those who have rights in sites. The owners are considered to be

the ones who own the appropriate sacred objects for the site. As one of the

younger ceremonial men, Djangirrawuy, said to me,

             Land owners are the wavarr wapq]u (custodians of the sacred
      beings). They are the magayin (sacred elements) owners, owners of
      sites and objects. He who owns the objects owns the land or area of
      land. In each area of land there are a number of major places. Like in
      this place, the town area, the ratjpa (iron ore rock) is Gunbirri varaka
      (lit core or bones).
             This place is Gunbirri, but Golumala entitled because walalavgu
      likan dhuwal (their sacred connection here). The original foundation
      (Luku) is Gunbirri. ~aymil has bundurr(sacred names) and likan here
      so they have rights. Garrawurra <!:iya-gawumirr clan's surname), !:iya-
      galawumirr, !:iya-dhalinymirr [Djambarrpuy:ou] and Birritjama
      (biipurru) also have likan and bundurr. Warrukay songs travel as far as




26 This being so it is possible to see that the Yolgu men involved were using the occasion of
the drawing of maps for Berndt as a political activity in which. while acting as informants.
they were SCeking to use the Anthropologist in the pursuit of their own interests.
27 Recognising that the island lies in a north east to south west line. the arrow indicating
north ofthe Berndt map is actually pointing to the west.

      the other country in both directions. From Gunbirri to Mfilarra and also
      from Malarra to Gunbirri.
            Golumala have the same magayin (sacred elements). They still
      come in and announcing here this place.


            In pursuing this distinction between ownership and rights, he

gave an example from his own country at Lake Evella and then returned to

discussing the situation at Elcho.

             I came from Luugutja, Lake Evella. The bird called burala
      (cormorant) came to Lake Evella when it was flat dry land there and he
      established the lake (dug it with his wing). He was Dhajwauu from
      Gangan. Dharuk :gayi (Language he) change to Gupapuyuu and
      biipurru (here= sacred names)- everything automatically changed
      because he was in a different land with different languages. Then he
      died there. That means :garaka, his bones are our magayin (sacred
      elements). His arm was caught in the biyiwiya (reeds). He hit
      Yathalamarra with the other arm and then tried but stuck with two
      arms.
             [Those others] Can pretend to look like, but can't create an object.
      They could copy, but can't make the real thing. It's their bird but they
      can only sing. They can't create the object.
             It's like that at Elcho. They can claim, but they can't make the
      sacred object. They can create, but have to get authority from the
      wa:garr waprgu. (custodians of the sacred beings) They can claim the
      journey and establishment and settlement, but they can't claim the ra:gga
      (sacred objects), because it belongs to someone. It's [Galiwin'ku town
      site is] actually my own father's mother's country so he is the one who
      owns the ra:gga (sacred objects). Its Dhuwa but they are all gone so
      even though he's Yirritja, he owns it. His mother and uncle are gone.
      That's the reason. That's the YolJJu way of legal, unless someone of
      Dhuwa [moiety] had learned from my father magayin'ku (about the
      sacred elements). If they don't know the patterns and objects, they got
      no say.
             Djiniyini's father's pattern may be the same or similar. That
      would give some patterns and part ownership of his father's
      establishment here :gunhi :gayi bunan (when he arrived) here, sent by
      Djupandawuy's mother's father and sister. He was a brother to Buthan
      and Mulupu and Munukarri [the last three Gunbirrtji people resident
      on Elcho]. The reason he came was that he was requested, plus they
      wanted him to look after the magayin (sacred elements). He grew up at
      Milingimbi and was a chosen man to come here from Gunbirri and
      Mfilarra.


            From this it would appear that this man is claiming that authority

over land, including ownership is related to control of experiential

knowledge of the ra:gga (sacred elements) associated with a particular place.

However in the case of the Galiwin'ku township he is going beyond the

normal moiety bounds and claiming that his own father has ownership rights


                                          208
                                           Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.

in spite of belonging to the opposite moiety. In this his argument is based on
the fact that his father's mother was one of the last two Gunbintji clan
members on Elcho. This was the only example I found of such a strong
claim being made on a matrilineal and cross-moiety basis, although a man as
waku (woman's child) does have the responsibility of caring for his mother's
clan's sacred objects28.

             In contrast to these claims, I should note here that there is a
younger man from a section of the Gunbintji at Milingimbi, who has moved
to Galiwin'lru. This man is being cultivated by some members of the
Gundapuy Djambarrpuy:gu clan as the person with the real ownership rights
in the town site.

             Virtually all ethnographic accounts of Yol:gu society mention in
some way, and with varying degrees of documentation, the mythological
basis and support for the ownership of precisely defined land by particular
groups of Yol:gu.29 There are also rights to the use of land which may be
based on historic or economic use. As Williams (1986: 18) suggests:
             For Yolngu as well as other Aborigines, the charter that
      establishes and validates all categories of rights in land is first of all
      religious. It is also historic. Thus for example, Yolngu may use past
      residence as an argument for continued residence or even stronger
      rights of tenure, along with or even instead of a founding myth. The
      charter is also economic. But forY olngu 'religious', 'historic', and
      'economic' are not mutually exclusive categories; they are
      complementary and reinforcing modes of perceiving and using land
      and natural resources (cf R. Berndt 1964:265, Berndt and Berndt
      1977 :95). The charter ultimately provides the lexicon for continuity in
      relationship to the land.

             From my own contact with the Yo]-Ou, it appears to be as
Williams argues, that in the vast majority of cases, a mythological basis is


28 Several men of the infonnant's Gupapuyuu clan have married women from Golumala
clan. Their children will thus inherit strengthened rights as these come from both
matriline and pattiline, in spite of carrying these rights mattilineally.
29 Among such writers are; Warner, Thomson, Berndt, and Berndt, Morphy, Keen,
Peterson and Williams, but there are many others and an extended list is pointless here.


                                                   209

given for land ownership. While she suggests that there are historic and

economic arguments that can take precedence over the religious, or

mythologically based ones, it would appear from the literature, and my

experience, that such bases for argument, where used, are likely to be linked

to a mythological content.


             There are a number of named sites with significance around the

Galiwin'ku township, but to the south of the town along the island's coast is

an area of much greater importance. This area is named Dhambalauur.30 An

examination of some details associated with this area will serve to further

illustrate Y oJ.uu understandings of space.


      Dhambal~ur.


             Dhambalauur (See Map 5.5), the section of land in the south

western comer of Elcho Island, is one of the sites visited by the Djau'kawu

sisters in their travels. It occupies approximately four kilometres of the

coastline and features a number of distinctive rocky outcrops of eroded

multicoloured sandstone, many of which are understood to be

transformations of one kind or another that are a result of the Djau'kawu

visitation. The area includes all the named sites shown on the map from

ijurruwurrunhana to Barrauura, and photographs of two of them are

included here as Plates 5.1, and 5.2.


             When the DjaIJ'kawu Sisters arrived here they came from a !,:iya-

gawumirr clan site on the mainland at GarriyakIJur. When they came they

brought with them in their bark canoe many .ranga(secret/sacredobject)

carried in their van.marra (conical woven mats with fringes on them). I was

told two different versions of their arrival. The first was as follows,

             The Djau'kawu came in a canoe called Guluwurru. They were
      DhaJ.kurruawuy and Barratawuy who came in the canoe, but also there
      were those two here, Gugurrku!UIT and Ganyitiuu." He said of these
      latter, "Don't know if male or female. They take the one stone, it was
      already there. Munukarri, Golwa, Majupu, Gunbini [three Gugbini
      clan membersPI were here when they arrived.The Djau'kawu
      gu4]iyinan Minbir~ur (went 'inside' at Migbir~ur). The Djau'kawu
      made all fresh water holes there dhonay (with digging sticks).


             This description includes the names of at least two people who

were alive in the 1940s when the mission was founded, so apart from an

earlier set of people with the same names, would date the Djau'kawu arrival

in the 1920s to 1930s. According to two other men talking together and

naming people who may have been dead before the mission or may have

been attributed ancestors, including one, Ganyitiuu, named in the first

version,

              The two Djau'kawu came ashore at Galuagi':uur. They met two
      ancestors there called Gurrulkurrul and Ganyiti:uu. They were
      [members of the] Gunbirri [clan]. The two [Djau'kawu] sisters sailed
      from Garriy~ur to there. The two locals started to sing songs.
      Djau'kawu heard the songs and said, '!'farraku balany bili'. (Mine are
      just the same). So the songs came dhipUfJuruvurruvunydja (from here
      first). The two Gunbini sang with bilma (clapsticks) and ganydjarryu
      (with power, or powerfully). After that the biJ.ma were left there.


              In the early 1970s, one of these clapsticks was given as a gift to

the church by the Liya-gawumirr clan and cemented into the front wall of the

church building. Bunbatjun says that he has seen a number of these stones

uncovered by cyclonic storms which move the sand cover from the beach.

Two of them are now set up in a small clearing right beside the track down

to the beach at Barrauur with the top half of each (about 30 to 40 cm)

exposed. (see Plate 5.2).




31 These three names were on another occasion given as the names for the last three
Gunbirri clan members on Elcho.

             On a different occasion I was told that the Dja,u'kawu were met

by the man Garrawurra32 of the ~iya-gawumirr when they came ashore at

Gal:oaQi'uur. Two different free standing rocks, each about five metres tall,

were said to be transformations of this man. One of these is in the midst of

the rocks at Dhapi Dhapmaram, and the other as the most prominent of the

free standing rocks at Minbirkijur. (See Plate 5.1 ).


             At GaI:oaQi':our, "There is white clay inside that is not for use at

any time. !fathil gan usim [Someone used it before], but got killed." Further

along the beach are some conical rocks which were identified as the

Dja,u'kawu .uagmarra (conical mats) that had been used to carry the sacred

objects. These were slightly south of the point shown on the map as

Djamarrkuli lup!upthurr (lit. the children swam) and a separate site from the

one identified on the map as ijanmarra nhirrpar (lit. the mats were put).


             Djilipa and Bunbatjun said that,

             "The local two (Gunbirri) gave to Dja_u'kawu (their marl
      [M.M.B.])33 saying,'! give authority and responsibility to you,
      manikay (songs), magayin (sacred things), land'. They gave the
      springs of gapu (water) and names of places. The Dja,u'kawu were
      Liya-gawumirri when they came here so now all is Liya-gawumirr.
      They identified with ~iya gawumirr like you, [me the anthropologist],
      are identified with Rirratji:ou [The clan into which I was first adopted].
      All the secrets from Garriyakijur [the Liya-gawumirrclan's homeland
      centre], bathi (sacred basket}, .uanybak(ceremonial arm bands), and
      yiilrumirriya.ual (putting of names), all the named places at
      Dhambalauur, were given by Dja:o'kawu. The names came from
      Garriyakijur to here. Walinydjuna,uur (Walinyuna) is the name of a
      place there and here".


              Much of the Dja,u'kawu activity was focussed at the short section

of coast named Minbirkijur.34 Towards the southern end of this area is the



32 Garrawurra is now the name adopted as smname by the biya-gawumirrclan.
33The name Djau'kawu as used here refers to both the "creative ancestors" and to their
transformation in the form of the biya-gawumirr men who have brought the cult to the local
site.
34 There are several other variations of the name Minbirkgur such as Minbirrkgur and
Minbirrkmirri~ur.

site known as Go:u burakina gapilay (lit. hand pierced by gapila) where the

Dja:u'kawu women had their hands pierced by the fish name gapila (possibly

a catfish).


              Slightly closer to the centre of Minbirkijur is a walu (sun) site

which is a series of multi-coloured boulders which spread across the sandy

beach from the bush to below the high tide mark. This site is invariably

named as some variation of the sun's activity such as Walu walman (lit. the

sun came out) or Walu ga dharra (lit. the sun is standing). I was told that,

           Walu is rjaymil, Da,!iwuy, and~iya-gawumirr. There are other
      rjaymil, and Da,!iwuy, places at Garriyakijur.


              The central feature of Minbirkijur is named Dhulmu :uarra (lit. the

important ceremonial place). It is described as the butJgawa (boss) forthe

whole area and a very important place. I was carefully shown a rounded

stone and told that there was a. second one like it currently hidden by sand

movement. It was explained that these were the transformations of the

Dja:u'kawu women themselves when they "went inside" here. The special

nature of Dhulmu :uarra was impressed upon me by different people in a

number of ways.

            With reference to the rounded stones, "The bundurrterms used
      during buku-lup (cleansing ceremonies) and munatha (sand sculpture)
      are Bandjurra, Bupuyurru and Djinmila, and their meanings cannot be
      printed". And again,

             This is a very special place where women are not allowed to go.
      They can walk past along the beach and see it from there and pictures
      are all right. When the agreement was made for ~iya-gawumirrto care
      for this country, this is the place it was made.

            When some people go there they sing and pray . Once when I
      had a very bad boil on my neck and it wouldn't heal, I went there and
      knee led down inside [near the rounded stone] and prayed to God,
      "God I'm here with these secret symbols that you gave us. Help me
      God." I got better then. No-one else done that.

             The focus ofDhulmu :garra is the set of three large rocks (see

Plate 5.1) that lean together supporting each other. It is near these, and"more

inside" that the rounded stone is found. In this general area also, and below

the high tide mark springs of fresh water bubble up from the sand at low

tide. These are the springs mentioned earlier that were dug by the Dja:g'kawu

sisters with their digging sticks.


             I have considered just some of the varied features of

Dhambala:gur. Even in this selection it becomes obvious that each of the

named features has an extensive association with significant activities of

ancestors or of mythological entities. It would be easy to extrapolate from

this that all names for places were derived from such sources, but as I will

show later in this chapter the naming of places can have a much more varied

development. What does show clearly in this small collection of named sites

is that the physical features of the geographic space function as a kind of

reference tool for oral history. As one man said to me, the landscape

functions as a library for the Yol:gu people. Each different feature is used as

both a proof of historical or mythological events which are considered to

have happened there, and as a memory peg to which the oral history is able

to be attached. This is however a "library" with the potential for being

continually rewritten, with the same "proofs" used differently for different

purposes and as mentioned above, transferred from one location to another.


             Ownership of areas, and proof of it as I have indicated earlier, is

associated with control over such tangible evidence of ownership as sacred

objects, paintings, song cycles, names and their meanings. In the above

discussion of features at Dhambala:gur, it was shown that several clans have

particular interests in the area. Local (Elcho) tradition has it that the area is

really Gunbirrtji country, but that they arranged for the Liya-gawumirrto


                                            217

take over responsibility for it. The Garrawurra35 received this authority over

the site from the Gunbirrtjii on the basis of a statement made by the Gunbirri

to them,

            /farra djamany, nheny buvgawa, nhe Liya-gawumirr.(We'll be
       the workers and you will be the bosses.you ~iya-gawumirr ).


              As a result of this exchange and also as proof of it Daypurryun 2,

now ceremonial leader of the ~iya-gawumirrpeople paints pictures associated

with the Dja,u'kawu and their activities at Dhambala,uur. As to how he

obtained these rights personally, Daypurryun said that when his father died he

inherited these designs from his father. He also said that the red paint used for

painting this site is ratjpa (blood red haematite ore from the deposit at the

Galiwin'ku town site), not miku (red oxide).


              One of his paintings (Plate 5.3.) is in the Australian National

Gallery in Canberra. Some time after having visited Dhambala,uur and

mapping the sites with Daypurryun, I showed him the photo of this painting

and asked him if he would tell me about it.36 At first he told me of the

physical features of the landscape represented in it. As the features in the

painting are referred to here the numbers referred to match those on the

diagram of the painting in Figure 5.4.


              The pattern of small circles (3 and 4) were representations of the

waterholes or fresh water springs that are found on the sand at low tide in

that area. They were, he said, dug by the Dja,u'kawu using their wapitja

(digging sticks). They are linked by rivulets of fresh water (6 and 8) and by

mirriya luku (tracks of the crab) that run between them (7). The oval shape at
one end of the painting (1) named Banydjarra, is a guQda (stone), the rock



35 Garrawurra is the surname adopted by the ~iya-gawumirr clan.
36 I had not known until then that it was a painting of the centtal feature at Minbifk:our.

which is the transformation of the Djau'kawu sister. The striped circle, (5) at

the centre of the other half of the painting is Milminydjarrk and represents

dirty water.


               This was the initial explanation of the meaning of the painting,

however over a period of time several other layers of meaning were

explained. At a second level of explanation it was said that the Djau'kawu

brought bathi (baskets) as well as the wapitja (digging sticks) with them. The

meaning of the oval shape at this level of explanation has changed so that it

now represents the Djau'kawu basket. At the end of the basket, the circle (2)

is a waterhole dug by the digging stick. At first dirty water (6) comes up

after the digging stick enters into dry places (4) then, after the first flowing of

dirty water, the water comes up clear (8).


               There was then a third level of explanation which was related to

the sexual and reproductive capacity of women. The wapitja at this level is a

penis. The woman's basket (1) is her reproductive organs. This is the same

basket that is spoken of in the Dja:o'kawu story as being stolen by the men,

giving the men control over all the sacred objects, of which the

representations of sexuality, copulation and reproduction are focal. At the
                                                                 I



end of the oval shape nearest to the waterhole (2) is a pattern representing

the pubic triangle. This pattern is repeated in the diagonal lines at the other

end of the painting. The water hole (2) is now perceived as the entrance to

the vagina. The sections which were explained as clean and dirty water rising

and flowing (3, 5, 6 and 8) are now explained as the various body fluids of

menstruation and copulation.


               There is a division (9) between two halves of the picture. One

half appears to refer to menstruation focussing on the "water holes" (4) as

the source of menstrual flow, with menstrual blood said to be indicated by

the dark lines flowing outwards from them (6). The other half appears to
focus on aspects of copulation and procreation. The mirriya luku (crabs
footprints) remain unexplained, but by implication of the other symbols
could represent the flow of seminal fluids.

             At this level of explanation the earlier levels are not replaced but
incorporated as simultaneously true. The rock which is the Dj~'kawu
woman is not just a rock but a transformation of the woman herself and of
her basket. The rock is found inside the area known as Dhulmu ijarra (lit
the important ceremonial place) where the arrangements for the transfer of
ownership from Gunbirrtji to !:iya-gawumirr were made (Plate 5.1). There
are within this series of interpretations the implications that the earth itself is
considered as female, and that on the basis of male action represented by the
digging of waterholes by the wapitja (digging stick) the female earth
becomes reproductive and brings forth. This is another representation of the
idea discussed in Chapter 4 that a man can consider the earth itself to be the
mother that his clan uses to reproduce its identity.

             It can be seen from this discussion that in a significant site like

DhambalatJur, the land is perceived as a physical space, but that
simultaneously it is a non-physical space. It has both outside and inside
aspects. The various rocks and springs along this stretch of coastline are
rocks and springs and the fresh water that flows from such an area is fresh
water for drinking (although some may have restricted access). These are all
very physical objects. They are not just the outward form of something else.
Nevertheless the rocks are not just outward form, they are also
simultaneously something else. Each named rock is a physical rock but also a
transformation of some aspect of the inner side of reality, be that a meeting
place, a black cockatoo, a clan founder, an ancestral woman or her

reproductive system. This inside of reality is not visible to the physical eye,
but is known through revelation. Thus in these ways the land has
simultaneously a physical outside manifestation and an inside unseen reality.

      Galiwin'ku        Township.

            Galiwin'ku, the major settlement on Elcho Island, has a flexible
population of somewhere between 1000 and 1500 people. It was established
originally as a Methodist Mission in 1942, but since the mid 1970s has been
managed by an autonomous Aboriginal council. In the town live members of
approximately 20 clans, (the number varies with the movements of people),
who have come to settle from various areas within Arnhem Land. A small
number of closely related and intermarrying clans can be said to manage the
town and its facilities, largely to their own advantage.

            In their control lies the ownership of the store, management of

the council, (Galiwinku Community Inc.) and the church. The council has the
responsibility for town management, oversight of the hospital and staff,
supervision of most contractors, maintenance of peace, sanitation and roads,
power supply and fuel, and they also have to deal with some fifty or more
government agencies. Consequently the same group of clans also control the
major sources of finance, employment, and the distribution of housing.

            At the old end of the town, and separately financed by
government agencies is the Marthakal Outstations Resource Centre. This has
completely separate Aboriginal management which relates to a different set
of clans and is concerned with the development of settlements in the various
outstation or homeland centres. Of these, fourteen are on Elcho, another five
on adjacent islands and twelve on the mainland. (See Map 5.2 and Table5.2).




                                              223
                                      Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.



            Both the Galiwin'ku Community Inc and the Marthakal Resource

Centre employ a number of Aboriginal staff, plus white staff where work to

be done involves management, accountancy, professional or trade skills that

are unavailable in the Aboriginal community. The only other sources of

employment are the store and the school. The store periodically employs a

white store manager in addition to Aboriginal staff, and the school, while it

employs the largest single body of white staff, also employs and continually

upgrades the training of approximately 20 Aboriginal teachers.


            In 1990 the relatively busy small airport had two permanently

based Missionary Aviation Fellowship (M.A.F.) planes with 4 pilots with

their families accommodated in the town. The airport serves as the major

centre for the movement of goods and people to the homeland centres that are

off the island. The aerial medical service based in Gove flies serious medical

cases to hospitals in Gove or Darwin, and there are daily passenger/freight

planes from Darwin. Apart from the store, the church, and several

independent artists, the rest of the town is directly dependent on one form or

another of government funding. This ranges from the salaries of those

directly employed as government staff to capital grants, and various forms of

pensions and unemployment benefits. Apart from hunting and gathering,

which is actively pursued on the outstations, and the few artists, all other

forms of production of goods and income ceased shortly after control of the

town was transferred from the mission to the Aboriginal council. Therefore

by proxy control is in the hands of the multiple government agencies who

fund everything that is done and hence largely control the people's choices

through the control of the use of the funds.

              The original site of the settlement was between a freshwater

swamp to the south and a permanent freshwater spring on the foreshore. The

first cottages for the Yol:gu were constructed from timber sawn in the mill on

the island. These were built on timber stumps and with timber floors. On

Map 5.6. these are shown in the area marked "pre-1965".


              Development of housing spread and by approximately 1970 a

township had developed to the much larger area marked as "by 1970" which

included a new church, school, sports oval, power house, a large market

garden, and workshops for engineering, boat building, mechanics and

carpenters as well as a saw miU.37 The street named Du!U:ogurra ran to the

garden and the new airstrip to the north of the town and as it followed it's

course, neatly marked the boundary between the sandy area to the south and

the rocky deposits of low grade iron ore on which the rest of the town has

subsequently been built. A town plan was developed at that time which has

been adhered to fairly closely ever since. Little further extension was made to

the town area after 1980 and most of the houses built during that time were

replacements for earlier small, and no longer suitable ones. 38


              Under the Aboriginal Council, housing has been allocated to

groups of related families living in separate areas. On the map of clan areas

within the town, seven of the ten areas identified can be classified as being

occupied by intermarrying pairs of clans, with the larger clans dominating the




37 Mission staff initiated market gardens, engineering, fishing, furniture manufacture,
forestry and sawmilling. These were all closed down by _government agencies by one
method or another as onviable. With their closure, all training and empfoyment in these areas
ceased.
38 Currently there are a number of cottages, empty for one reason or another that are being
gradually demolished by small children as they await replacement with new buildings.

These groupings are shown in Map 5.7.39

             According to local tradition, the town area, as part of the
southern section of the island is, as already mentioned, owned by the
Gunbirrtji people, with just the one young GU!lbirrtji man in the town who is
stated by some to be the traditional owner. When Harold Shepherdson first
visited Elcho and sought approval to establish a mission there, he visited the
two "old" Gunbirrtji women who lived there. He brought with him two
Yo]-Ou men, Wili Walalipa of the Golumala clan and Ba13-0ga of the Wangurri
clan to act as interpreters. Wili, according to one Yo]-Ou man had been given
agreement to come by Gunbirrtji people at Milingimbi. This was affirmed by
the "old ladies" because Golumala had connections with the Gunbirrtji
through sharing the Warrukay (Barracouta) site with them. From the Yoll)u
point of view it has been through this Warrukay connection that Golumala
gained their rights in the town as it developed, rather than by the historical
fact that Will came across with Harold Shepherdson to help in the
establishment of the mission, although this latter fact is used as support for
their claims. Because Golumala and l'jaymil have equal rights in Wanukay,
they gain some rights in the town area through that connection.40.

             The ~iya-gawumirr clan have a very close association with
GU!lbirrtji through ceremonial and through acting as caretakers for the
Djau'kawu sites at Dhambalauura in the southern end of the island. If the
Gunbirrtji clan were to completely die out, they have established a primary
claim to inherit the area.


39 Relations between the pairs of clans involved (yothu yindi pairs) were discussed more
fully in Chapter 3
40 They also have other strong claims in the rocky iron ore area together with DaPwuy
through both BB[1umbirr(the Morning Star) and WJUao(the sugar glider), who brought
the ratjpa (iron ore) to Galiwin'ku from their countty at Rorru. (See also Chapter 7).


                                                   228

              Djupandawuy of the Gupapu~u Birrkili, a Yirritja clan, is eldest

son of one of the two "old" Gunbirrtji ladies, and through this has gained

rights for his family line in the local land as indicated in a quote from one of

his sons earlier in this chapter. These rights have more recently been

reinforced by his sons having married five Golumala women, and a woman

each from Da!iwuy, rjaymil and Liya-gawumirr clans all of whom have

rights in the town area.41


              In spite of all these claims and counter claims, the GupapuyIJu

DjambarrpuyIJu combination, by virtue of the simple weight of numerical

strength, appears to occupy the largest number of houses. The Liya-

gawumirr are mostly on the eastern side of town, Gfilpu and W arramiri on

the south-east of the newer section, while rjaymil and Da!iwuy, both very

small clans have been almost completely excluded from the power structures.

In contrast to them, Golumala, achieving an initial dominance through both

the mission structure and the ceremonial links, have gained a

disproportionately large number of houses and also of executive positions in

the town.


              The southern end of the town, approximately south of Galawarra

Rd, is part of a section of land owned by the Liya-galawumirrclan(distinct

from Liya-gawumirr). This includes Mission Beach and the area of the

swamp which drains out at the southern end of the beach. I have not

discovered who has subsidiary rights in this section, but DjambarrpuyIJu

Guyula clan have established some rights there by having lived there for over

forty years and recently by burying one of their senior men there.



41 Thus their children inherit rights through both matriline and patriline.




                                                  229

              There has been a town cemetery in use since the foundation of

the mission. In addition to this and for a variety of different reasons, there

have, in the last ten years, been three groups who have buried clan members

adjacent to the houses in their areas of town, and two of these have

developed into small clan group cemeteries42.


              The Gfilpu clan buried the senior member of their clan on a

vacant lot between the houses in 1981. Later a second senior man was buried

beside him. In the 1989 wet season, a much loved young man from the same

group was to be buried in the town cemetery, but when the grave was dug

there, the water table had risen and the grave filled with water. As a result the

choice was made to bury him beside the old men (Plate 5.4).


              In 1983 the Golumala clan chose to bury the senior man of their

clan on a Warrukay (barracouta) site adjacent to their homes and next to the

hospital which is also built on the site. Their choice has been explicitly stated

as an action to emphasise their claim to the adjacent section of the town to

live in on the basis of their particular rights in the Warrukayceremonial

complex. Since that time several further members of the family have been

buried there (Plate 5.5).


              The third clan area involves a single grave in the southern end of

town which has been located right beside the "Elcho Island Memorial"

(described by Berndt 1962). The memorial has been gradually surrounded

by houses built for the Djambarrpuyuu Guyula group who have since the

1940s lived adjacent to the beach. The old man buried there belonged to the

clan and his daughter lives in the house seen in the photograph as next to the

grave and the memorial. (Plate 5.6)

            In summation then, the township of Galiwin'ku is a ferment of

Yol:ou politics, a continuous scene of claim and counter claim with all

potential bases for leverage being employed; every act, every word spoken

carrying within it some political implication. Every action is weighed and

then counterbalanced as far as possible. Every marriage is considered in

terms of advantage and disadvantage. Every funeral is, among other things,

a statement of relationships, a levering for advantage and an occasion for

imposing obligations on others. The establishment of dominance over

individuals both Y ol:ou and white, over groups such as clans, "missionaries",

town departments or government agencies, and over economic assets all

eventually lead to the aims of control over religious elements of all kinds and

through them towards long term goals of control over land.


            All of these actions then appear to be aimed at the ego-centred

expression of a powerful identity; the YoI:ou equivalent to big-man-ship.

This when interpreted through the idea of an unchanging eternal identity

enables the perception that dominance is justified by the eternal unchanging

reality of that which is, which verifies the dominance as an expression of the

innerreality.


      Space Beyond Arnhem Land.

            For a considerable length of time, the Yol:ou have been aware

that the physical world was much bigger than their own country of North-

east Arnhem Land. For centuries there were regular visits from Indonesian

sailors collecting a variety of products from these coastal lands. At various

times, some Y ol:ou had returned with them to Indonesia, or Ma:ogatharra as

they called it, so that there was no consideration that Indonesia was anything

other than a real place. More recently, during this twentieth century with the

continuously increasing contact with the rest of the world, YoI:ou have

                                         234
                                       Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.

travelled to all the continents except Antarctica and perhaps South America.
Some have been to Africa, others to America and Asia. In 1988 a party of
over twenty visited Israel and Germany and others have visited New Guinea,
the Pacific Islands and South-east Asia. More recently, the Yo)-Ou band
named Yothu Yindi has toured the United States and some of Europe. The
number who have visited at least the capital cities of Australia is quite large.
For some, long distances have become no more significant than a trip to the
other end of the island. With television in most homes now, the whole
world, and even outer space, has become part of the Arnhem Lander's
environment.

            One question that this widened experience presents in terms of
the purposes of this thesis is, "What effect if any, this has had on the Yoluu
cosmos and on their interpretation of it in their cosmology?" One response to
this broader experience has been for people to incorporate aspects of the
wider world within their traditional framework, as the following texts
indicate. George Dayuumbu shared the following perceptions of extensions
to Yo]-Ou geographic relations by means of links through magayin (sacred)
items.
             One story, I'll talk about the magayin (sacred things), I'll give an
      example about myself from the Mandjikay biipunu (group), we
      Mandjikay used to think mistakenly in the old days that the Mandjikay
      finished from Dhalinyuur and Gumatj and Magarrpa and Dhalwauu
      and Mat>galili groups. That's what we thought was the limit of
      Mandjikay, but we Mandjikay went further like to Groote Island or
      Numbulwar or to Roper River or Momington Island or Weipa or on
      further to Palm Island or Thursday Island. We find that Mandjikay is
      there as well, because on that other side we find connections there, our
      familyship truly continues on there because they really have our
      magayin (sacred thing) there. The sacred magayin I'a{Jga (sacred
      objects) gives us familyship. We used to think that we had a limit
      where we stopped with the MaQ.arrpa people, and back this way from
      there. And now we can consider the direction of the sunset, maybe its
      just the same over that way, those Mandjikay continue on that way too
      through the one magayin (sacred thing) continuing they have
      gamunUJJgUluku (sacred designs) we have in the one way balanya bili
      Gust like that). Now we know we (Mandjikay) go far away. Our




                                               235
                                       Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.

      relationships are firm and truly through the one magayin (sacred
      things) and through the luku gamunuvgu (sacred designs).
             Like those Yol:gu over at Broome have Dja:g'kawu, there is part
      of the family there Djerrkuwuy Yol:gu and the further we go on the
      further we find the same traditions, like Andy (Galiwinku's resident
      Makassan) but further west we find the same people with the same
      traditions there, same magayin (sacred things) goes on and on like that.


            This aspect of finding ceremonial links and hence establishing

what relationships exist with other Aboriginal people appears to be quite

widespread. One young man, Brian Djangirrawuy, who had travelled

throughout Queensland touring with an Elcho Island music group made the

following comment,

             While on a band tour through Queensland we discovered
      relations atKoenyama, andLockhardtRiver. We hadgurtha (fire),
      guku (honey), and wunpafl (emu), so we must be wiiwa (brother).

            In both these quotes, the assumption is made that the

relationships were in existence before they were discovered. The discovery

identifies the particular relationship not just between the people, but also

between the places. Day:gumbu's experience of finding shared ritual elements

enables him to recognise that on this basis those that have the same as him

are relations, and as Djangirrawuy explains, it is possible to attribute exact

kin relationships on this basis.


            In the past, celestial space has been considered as a

transformation of the normal everday space inhabited by the Yol:gu, a

transformation which has occurred as a result of specific actions or events.

Myths associated with the heavenly bodies appear to be of two types, those

known to be associated with ceremonial like the Morning Star complex

discussed in Chapters 7 and 8, and those of what could be called the "just-

so" type in the Kipling sense that they tell about the origins of certain of the




                                          236
                                               Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.


celestial bodies.43 While fairly widespread, there is no unified body of such

stories. There are some celestial bodies for which variations of a single story

can be traced right across Arnhem Land. Others may have several different

explanations of origins within a single community.44 No conflict appears to

be seen when stories of the same subject having completely different details.

It would appear that for each narrative, truth is according to the context of the

narration and the stories are able to be used differently for different purposes.


               Each of the identified celestial bodies, as mentioned above, is

seen, at least in traditional stories, as associated with a human event.

Elements of the human event are described as historical experience, the

evidence for which is now visible in the sky.                Most of these stories have

clan-specific ownership although those with ceremonial associations are

owned by all those clans which share the ceremonial complex together.


               In the 1990s these myths are still preseived but in the

confrontation with the input from television programmes and Western

education are described in terms of, "These are the stories from our culture".

Thus celestial space is now seen as having different explanations each of

which tends to be kept in its own cultural box. There are known traditional

explanations of space as transformations of human space on earth, and

known Western explanations of physical objects in space I have no record

of anyone denying the veracity of either explanation and it would appear as if

they are simply held as alternative explanations relevant to different contexts.



43 I would SllSpeCt however that in the majority of cases where a myth can be identified as
being of this latter type, there either is, or was a ceremonial counterpart.
44 There are totally different stories of the Milley Way told by the Mm,)£alili at Yirrkala and
the L_iya-galawumirr at Milingimbi and Elcho Is. In contrast to this the'"Morning Star has a
single story with variations which can be traced from the Djapu and Gfilpu in the south-east
of Arnhem Land, to groups of the Burarra speaking people wllo live outside the Yo}Uu
language area on the cental north coast.

   CONCLUSION.

             In the discussions throughout the various stages of this chapter it

has been demonstrated that the Yol:uu have a pragmatic perception of the

physical space in which they live, of its assets and of the political processes

of relationships, leverage and patronage that are used in seeking control over

or access to such assets. Such access is a continually fluctuating dynamic

involving a constant interplay and the ongoing development of new strategies

such as the development of clan cemeteries as a means of staking or

emphasising claims.


             Beyond this perception of physical, outside attributes, the land is

also simultaneously recognised as the place where the "inside" or spiritual

reality becomes manifest. This is recognised in the naming of sites and the

mythological descriptions of various features of the land. There are seen to

be variations in the intensity of such manifestations. Some places are simply

recognised as the location of events of significance. At other places the

manifestations are far more intense and there are traces in the landscape

which are in themselves manifestations of, or transformations of some aspect

of the living entities of the inner side of reality. In this way physical space

itself becomes, not just the place in which manifestations of the inner

spiritual side of reality occurs, but in varying degrees or intensities, and more

intensely in particular locations, physical space is itself a transformation of

the inside of reality.


             Thirdly the land, through this pattern of transformations, is

converted into a series of interlinked sites held together in a network of

relationships with each other, with the sacred elements associated with the

beings manifest at the sites, and with the human groups affiliated with these.

This huge multi-layered network of relationships functions as a constantly

                                           238
                                        Chapter 5. - Relationships with Space.


changing organism in which the only thing which is reputedly unchanging is

the relationship between the sacred elements and the sites. As a result there is

constant political manoevering to either gain or maintain control over these

elements and hence over the sites.


            Not only are all such levels of relationship relative to all other

levels of relationship, but the location of any element in space is seen to be

relative to other locations, and distances relative to other distances. There are

no absolutes of measurement of space in any part of the cosmos, and without

absolutes this relativity is reflected in all associated aspects of the language.


            Because the network itself is constructed of points which may be

sites in space, sacred elements, or human groups, linked together by

relationships, and because the identity of the points depends on focus and not

on boundary, there are potentially no boundaries to the space which makes

up the Yol:gu Cosmos. New experiences, new knowledge, new contacts with

the outside world or beyond it are simply recognised as parts of the cosmos

previously unknown, and then, if relevant, brought into relationship.

            YOL:rjU TIME.
            INTRODUCTION.

            In the earlier chapters I have presented in various contexts the Yo4)u
claim that there is no change in the "inside" reality, showing that this includes
human identity and the inner nature of all things, and that what is observed is an
outward transformation of this unchanging inner side of reality.

            This being so a problem automatically arises when the concepts of time
are being considered, as time, by its nature, is associated with the passage of events
that occurs in association with change. The question put simply is, "How is it
possible to understand time if one presupposes an absence of change?" The YobJu
answers to this question are the subject of this chapter. In earlier chapters I have
shown that the observations of transformation are able to be related to perceptions
of changelessness and I show here how this relates to perceptions of time. I will
also attempt to show here how the attempts by Western observers to explicate these
relationships have resulted in the white Australian concept of "The Dreamtime". By
way of introduction to the subject I first examine briefly some of the basic
differences between Western and Yo4Ju notions of time.

      The Western Notions of Time.

            Western ideas of time and the measurement of time have a long history
with attempts being made to extend this to prehistoric stone structures found

widely spread across the British Isles and interpreted by some at least as early
observatories. Written statements relevant to the conceptualisation of time can be
traced back at least as far as the ancient Greeks and Hebrews. Isaac Newton, as

early as the seventeenth century in England was describing the conceptualisation of
time in much the same way as it is currently understood. Newton (1687 quoted in




                                              240
                                                              Chapter 6. Yol:nu Time.

Park 1980:24) suggested that, there is a contrast between "absolute time" which is

"duration" and "relative time" which is the measurement of duration. He wrote that,

                  Absolute, True, and Mathematical Time, of itself, and from its
            own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by
            another name is called Duration: Relative, Apparent, and Common
            Time is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable)
            measure of Duration by means of motion, which is commonly used
            instead of true time; such as an Hour, a Day, a Month, a Year ....


            Goodman (1964:367,368 as quoted in Schlesinger 1980:3,4) discusses

the analogous relationship between space and time. In this he draws out one clear

contrast between these two dimensions making the observation that position in time

cannot be altered. He says that,

                    ... the analogy between space and time is indeed close. Duration
            is comparable to extent. A thing may vary in color in its different
            spatial or its different temporal parts. A thing may occupy different
            places at one time or the same place at different times, or may vary
            concomitantly in place and time. The relation between the period of
            time occupied by a thing during its entire existence and the rest of time
            is as fixed as the relation between the region the thing covers during its
            entire existence and the rest of space. And yet there is this difference:
            two things may approach and recede from each other in space, they
            grow more and then less alike in color, shape, etc; but two things never
            become nearer and then further apart in time. The location or the color
            or the shape of a thing may change but not its time. (emphasis mine)


            Park ( 1980.40) in considering what time is, gives what he says is a

definition, as follows,

                   Time is what is measured by a clock, [adding that] A clock is a
            device whose law of motion is known [and (p43) that] In Newtonian
            terms, clocks measure the flow of time ..... we do not sense the flow of
            time at all, but rather the flow of events, and in these terms the ticks of
            a clock are merely some more events, controlled, counted, and
            registered.


            It should be noted here that this interpretation of "clock" by implication

includes any cyclic movement used to measure the duration of or the "flow of

time". Having established that this duration, or flow of time is perceived as the

flow of events, he indicates that there are two kinds of events. It is, so he argues,

the duration of one kind of event (unilinear and non-cyclical) that is measured in




                                          241
                                                                      Chapter 6. Yohiu Time.

relation to the passage of various consistently repeated (or cyclical) kinds of events.

He then (p59) elaborates the distinctions between these two kinds of events.

                     The natural events by which we measure time fall mostly into
              two categories: those which are fundamentally very simple and those
              which are very complex. The simple ones are the original clocks of
              mankind: the earth that spins once a day (as we would say) and orbits
              the sun once a year..... The other set of physical processes from which
              we derive our conceptions of time are of an entirely different nature: the
              growth of children, the changes in our own bodies and minds from
              hour to hour and from year to year, and, on a larger scale, the gradual
              changes in the earth's landscape of which we are dimly aware ..... In
              these processes the direction of time marked past is not for a moment
              marked future. Everywhere, at every instant, a single principle orders
              the flow of events. It does not control their rate but it decrees their
              direction in time. It is the second law of thermodynamics.


              When the implications of this discussion are considered, it is possible

to suggest that the locating of a particular event in time, and the process of the

measurement of time as practised in Western society have been developed from

basic observations of the relationship between the events being measured and the

cyclical movements of the earth around its own axis, and in its relation to the sun,

(although this was originally considered the opposite way around)l. Time span can

be considered as the duration between the recurrence of particular features. The

duration between successive noon sun positions gave us the duration or length of a

day, which was then divided into arbitrary units of hours, minutes and seconds. All

of these are used by the ordinary citizen to mark, with varying degrees of precision,

the passage of time along an irreversible continuum, for the location of events

along that continuum, and for the measurement of duration between events.


              This system of measuring duration has been extended by counting the

days between summer or winter solstices, calling that number of days a "year" and

arbitrarily dividing this into months. Years have been identified specifically by




1 More sophisticated measuring devices have been developed to measure duration, but this basic
principle appears to have remained unaltered.

counting their number from a chosen reference point, and months given names by
which they can be identified and numbered according to their sequential order. 2

                     The Western conceptualisation of time can be said to be based on
       a set of presuppositions and a number of focal concerns. For the purpose of
       comparison with the Yoluu approach I have isolated the following
       presuppositions.
                             a. Time is an entity which exists independent of events3.
                             (Newton's 'Absolute Time').
                             b. Duration (time) occurs in an unlimited linear continuum.
                             c. There are standard units of time by which time can be
                             measured.
                             d. Points of time can be identified (at ever more precise
                             locations) along the continuum of these standard units of
                             duration.
                             e. Location in time can be identified in relation to these
                             hypothetical points on the continuum.

              In addition to these presuppositions, the following focal concerns can
be distinguished,
            a. a focus on the duration of any event, and its measurement,
            b. a concern with the speed with which an event occurs.
            c. a focus on precise identification of the start and finish of an event,
            d. a concern for ever increasing precision of measurement.

       Yo~u       notions of Time.

              In contrast to the Western focus on the continuum of time, the Yoluu

focus is on the location of and power of events that occur in temporal space.
Amplifying this a little, their concerns can be said to be with,




2 This ~int is an ovei--simplification, but is as accurate as is needed for the present
discUSSIOD.
3 This appears to be a universally accepted fiction, whereas what has been established is a
system for measuring duration between events

            a. the location of events in relation to other events (that is the location
                markers in temporal space) and in geographic space

            b. the relationships between events,

            c. the intensity of, or power involved in an event, and,

            d. duration, primarily as an assessment of the effort (power) involved
               in an event.

            With this focus on events it becomes necessary to examine the types of
events that can be considered as in any way related to the Western notions of the
passage of time and the methods of locating events. In attempting to do this, I have
isolated, for discussion purposes, three different categories of event. While they are
my categories, and not as far as I know overtly Yol:ou ones, they would cause
YoI:ou people no difficulties in discussion.

            The first two of these match neatly with the two categories of events
described by Park (and quoted earlier). These are firstly, the set of continually
repeated events of the natural world such as the patterns of day and night, and the
annual return of the seasons (e.g. Figures 6.1, 6.2 and Tables 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3). The
second is the overall succession of unique experiences of the human lifespan along
which the events of the past, the present and the future are fitted (e.g. Figure 6.3).
In the discussion which follows I describe these two types of events as fully as I
am able, but the third type of event only in passing. In this third category are those
everyday and not so every day human and non-human events that are located
within the frameworks of the other two. That is, it is because of a need to locate
this third kind of event, that the first two types are used as sets of locations.

            It can be said that when the Yol:ou identify the temporal location of a
particular event, they identify a specific relationship between the event and one of
the repeating events or one of the unique lifespan events. Precision in this

reckoning is then relative to the choice of particular events.

              This could almost be a description of the way the time of an event is

decided in Western society, though we would not normally express it this way.

However it is not just at this level that the contrasts lie, but also in the kinds of

events that are chosen, the ways in which they are perceived, and in the different

foci that the Yoluu have in their approach to time. In addition to this, the focus on

event rather than on time or its measurement, when combined with the absence of

any developed counting system4 has repercussions in the Y olJJu approach to

chronology and distance in time, which I will discuss separately, but first I turn to

an examination of the cyclical events.


              In the sections that follow, I examine Yoluu ideas of the types of

temporal events that exist, their systems of classifying such events, their

approaches to distance in time and the passage of time, and I consider some of the

ways in which various aspects of the YolJJu approach to time are reflected in the

language structures. Following this I will attempt to relate these ideas to other

Yoluu perceptions of the Cosmos.


   TEMPORAL                  LOCATIONS.

              There are two major sets of repeating events used in the classifications

of specific locations and some others that have less significance. One of the major

sets relates to the Western category of the twenty-four hour day, and the other can

be paralleled to the Western perception of a cycle of seasons. 5 Juxtaposed on these

two major sets of events the other minor sets include the movement of stars, of the
                       Sb
moon and the tides. Associated with them are known wind patterns which appear

to form cosmological events in their own right. Supplementary to these events, are




4 See Rudder 1983:54-94.
5 I have deliberately referred to these as repeated events rather than as cyclical to avoid the
implication of contllluum carried in the latter term in English. If a YoltJu idea of continuum
exists. it is as a continuum of sameness or chaD1telessness.           _

the repeated patterns of reproduction, and growth, of non-human living things by

which the seasons themselves are identified.



       Features of the repeated patterns of Day and Night

             The day consists of a succession of time events treated as recurring

states each of which is identified, not simply by the position of the sun in the sky,

but by what are considered to be the significant features of the particular segment

being classified so that each event is a temporal space with its own particular set of

qualitative attributes is seen to be effective, and each event then becomes a state in

which any continuum quality is classified out. These features include such events

as the positioning of sun, moon or stars, the pattern of human activities, the

position/direction of shade, the behaviour of natural species, and, on the coast, the

position of the tide.So


             Morning is the time of hunting, and of people going out from home,

with Some degree of expectation and excitement. Afternoon in contrast to this can

be a time of apprehension and of concern for the well being of other members of

the group, and there may develop a continual flow of questions concerning the

well-being of those not yet home. e.g. "Have they got into trouble?" "Has he been

bitten by a snake?" "Is she lost?" "Have they got a big turtle that has slowed them

down?"


              The segments of daylight hours which are of significance to the Yoluu

are illustrated in Figure 6.1, drawn to show an approximation of the view to the

south along the beach at Galiwin'ku. The succession of positions of the sun

overhead is represented as seen by a small group of people sitting in a "shade" on

the beach, by the curve of circles from left to right The corresponding Western

hour of the day is shown as the sun's approximate position each hour. Terms


Sc Geertz (1966:42) suggests that noting such events is one of the "ways in which men are made
aware, or rather make themselves aware, of the passage of time" (emphasis mine).

               While everyone knows that the time events occur sequentially, the

process of classification focuses not on the position in a continuum but on the

qualitative event itself, and the classification can be seen to be the identification of

one event in a known series of events, with any event being marked and identified

by the expression of a known set of qualities. Sunrise and sunset can then be seen

in context not as time points but as acts in a regularly rehearsed drama. In the
context of this regular drama any additional classifications are simply alternative
ways of identifying other qualitatively distinguished slabs of duration. 6

              In Figure 6.1, it is clear that the day is divided into a series of
classifications that represent qualitatively different sections of the day. The majority
of these cannot be considered to be marking off points of time, as they
unequivocally cover what in Western thought amount to periods of some duration,
though the variations in length are quite considerable and the periods of time
covered by each overlaps with the ones on either side of it. Several of the terms
could be interpreted as either time events or as points in time, but on the basis that
most represent classifications of qualitative states which replace each other in
sequence, it is my argument that the whole set need to be considered as forming a
continuous sequence of transformations from one state to the next. Although some
of those states are of a short enough duration to be considered as marking points in
time this is no more than co-incidence.

       The Repeating Pattern of Seasons.

              In the Western calendar there is an arbitrarily labelled set of months,
each with a set of days numbered from the first to the last . These months are then
arbitrarily imposed onto the four seasons each of which is declared to have
particular qualities and each of which is then expected to begin on the first day of a
particular month7. None of this has any relevance to the Yo]-Ou who observe the
successive states of the climate around them, identify particular states with other




6 One example of the way in which a new element can be included without distortion of the
overall drama came from a story told by one older man of an ex~rience he had This had, so he
said, coincided with the crying of the rooster. I checked to see whether he was referring to the
crying of the jungle fowl (sometimes given the same name), but not so, he had chosen a time
evenfbased on die introduced bird so that he could locate htS experience in relation to a time
event with which he felt I would be familiar.
7 I have assumed that in the earlier stages of our Western calendar's development, the two cycles
were independent of each other and that the seasons were identified by associated changes 10 the

the climate and always know which season they are in. One group of informants
described seven such "seasons" in Arnhem Land, their version of these being as
shown in Table 6.3.

             An alternative version given to me by Galpagalpa 1, included mayaltha
as the first section of migawarr and in its place substituted a different category
biirramirriy, which he termed as being a period of strong west winds and

continuous rains that make the country boggy (see Table 6.4). Lowe (n.d.) lists
biirramirri as a season before the wet season and lists mayaltha as a separate season

approximately in the same sequential order as I have it listed. When these different
observations are compared, it can be seen that the list supplied by Galpagalpa,
contains the whole of the group's list in the same sequence, except that his list adds
Biirramirriy, the time of the strong west wind, after the wet season while Lowe lists
it as being before the wet season, and his list incorporates mayaltha within
miflawarr. The winds described as blowing during particular seasons are in general

terms the same in both lists, although Galpagalpa's list appears to be both more
comprehensive and more precise. The only significant differences between the two
lists in this regard being in the descriptions of the winds that blow through
Gfl!111lul. So it would appear that while there are minor variations between

informants in the use of categories and sub-categories, the major details vary little.

             Significantly each of the eight terms that I have listed were described
with the same characteristics by all informants with again the only real differences
being in the description of Gll!l.mul. As to how many seasons there are in the
Yoliju calendar, there appear to be no absolute answers. 8




8 Davis (1989) has listed 6 seasons as if these are agreed to by all Yo~u.

  Season.            Description of Characteristics

  gunmul             which is characterised by "the big Rains". Winds at first are
                     from the west, then as the season progresses, they gradually
                     turn to the south and southeast

  mayaltha           is alternatively called marrayalvgi (lit. leaf soft) and
                     mayaya4Jgi. There are new soft leaves on root foods, trees
                     and 1rn1ss. There is also a !!feat scarcitv of vegetable foods.

  mifiawarr          has skies filled with beautiful clouds. The winds are mild,
                     predominantly from the east and north though sometimes
                     there are days without wind at all. The last scraps of rain
                     come with the northeast and east winds (midawarr).

  dharratharra       has cold weather with south-easterly wind and very
                     occasionally rain. Root foods are still available but leaves
                     have shrivelled.

  rarrandharr                     is identified by hot earth when the feet feel as
                     if they are burning. There is now little or no water in the
                     bush away from the permanent waterholes.There are
                     some light breezes from the east but predominantly from
                     the north, northwest or west. Vegetable foods are now
                     available from the billabongs but are mostly finished in
                     the bush. Native bees' hives are now productive.

  wulmamirr          (lit. thunder having), is hot and very humid. Early morning
                     breezes are from the south though through the day there may
                     be light breezes from the north, northwest or west. From the
                     islands off the north coast, big clouds are seen standing in the
                     south, lightning is seen flashing in them. There may be
                     electrical storms.

  dhulufiur          sees the first rain falls followed by a brief dry period. There
                     may be winds from the south. The first fruit forms and ripens
                     as soon as the rain falls; The 1rn1ss shoots szreen again.

Table 6.3. One version of the sequence of season terms in Arnhem Land.


              It seems to be common for an English speaker to see the calendar year

as having a beginning and an end, to list off the months commencing from January,

and the seasons starting with Spring. In contrast to this when Yol:uu list off the

seasons it appears normal to commence from the season currently being

experienced and then to continue to the end of the cycle. The sequence of the

seasons together with the approximate relation between these classifications, and

the Western calendar are shown in Figure 6.2.

      Figure 6.2. Relation between Yoluu and Western calender terms.

             In addition to identifying the climatic features as the basic
characteristics of each season the Yoluu frequently refer to the relationships
between the season and the cyclical patterns of the growth of the different natural
. species. That is, they comment on what they see as natural signs in the environment
which give an indication of what various natural species can be expected to be
doing concurrently. For example, when the gagayka (stringy bark trees) are in
flower is the time when matijurr(the flying fox) can be expected to be available in
abundance for hunting; similarly, when you see that the dhavgi and bal_gurrtrees
are in flower you can expect to see ganguri (a yam) putting out new leaves, but one
can also expect to be able to find young maranydjalk(stingrays and sharks) close
to the shore, and that they will be very sweet (rich in fat) at that time. It is the
concurrence of such events which forms the set of qualities by which a season is
marked.

             Some of these relationships were listed off for me by Galpagalpa as
mentioned earlier in association with the different sections of each season. In doing
this he associated together the section of the season, the particular wind that could
be expected at that time, the growth patterns to be noticed in the plants and the

particular attributes of the land, and sea creatures and birds that were relevant to

that particular classification of the year. This set of observations and expectations is

listed in tabulated form in Table 6.4.


      Other Repeating Patterns of Temporal Locations

             In addition to the two above sets of terms there are a number of

classifications used to identify other events which overlap with those of the twenty-

four hour and seasonal patterns. These refer to lunar stages, the movements of

tides, or of stars and stellar constellations.


             Associated with the Moon.


             The movements of the moon and its waxing and waning are recognised

as belonging to a different sequence of events from either the day or the seasons,

and at least some of the senior generation are aware of relationships between moon

and tides. I was told by one man th~t when the new moon was in "that" position in

the sky (about three quarters of the way from east to west) at dawn, then it was the

time of the neap tides, and someone else indicated that when the full moon is large

and close to the tree tops, the tide will be coming in. The position of the moon in

the night sky may be used as a basis for indicating a particular temporal location by

such terms as the following,

             valindi-walmanharay                      =moonrise. (lit.moon comes
                                                        out).
             vaJindi-giirrinyaray                    =moon setting (lit.moon going
                                                        in).
             vaJindi-djalkiri-bandanydhinyaray       =moon overhead (lit.moon feet
                                                        become dry).


             There are separate names for the moon in its different phases. The new

moon is called likan or novgurr(which are both terms for "elbow") or it may

simply be calledyufa (new) with the connotation of young. Birrkuis the full moon

              sat making a woven fish trap while his sons went hunting for food.
              On their return they ate the results of their hunting in front of him but
              gave him nothing. This made ijalindi extremely angry. He tricked the
              boys into climbing inside the fish trap, ostensibly to test it for him.
              When they were inside, he tied it shut, beat them to death and threw the
              trap with the bodies inside, into the water hole. His wives, on returning
              from hunting inquired of the boy's whereabouts and were told by
              ijalindi that he knew nothing about them. Eventually the wives
              discovered the bodies, and waited for the right opportunity for revenge.
              When ijalindi was asleep in their hut they built a large fire and burned
              him to death. As he was dying he rose up into the sky, becoming the
              moon as he did so and calling out that they would die, but he would
              keep coming back.


              It is in the terms of this latter myth that when the last phase of the

moon, called werr, is described, it is spoken of in terms of "getting sick and thin"

or "he is close to dying".


              The Tides and Tidal Currents.


              I was not able to investigate the perceived relationships between the

moon and the tides, but the ebb and flow of the tides and sea currents is well

known and the patterns of tidal flows along the Arnhem Land Coastline are used

both for travelling by canoe and as analogues of the relationships between different

groups whose land is linked by their flow. No-one would think of making a canoe

journey in a direction that was opposite the direction of the tidal flow, but would

wait until the currents turned in the direction that they wanted to go. 9 Some of the

major currents were drawn for me on maps of the coastline (see Map 6.1 ). Each of




9 With the advent of power boats the use of such currents appears to be a practice no longer
relevant. though the knowledge of them continues with some at least being enshrined in the
song cycles.

these currents was drawn by a person from a Yirritja moiety clan and I did not

discover any such currents relating to Dhuwa clans, though this may well have

been circumstantial.


            The movements of the tides out and in are of great importance to the

coastal clans. They affect both the men's hunting of fish and marine creatures and

the women's gathering of shellfish. The present pattern of tidal movements is

almost always known, and a number of temporal locations relate to the state of the

tide . For example,
            nJ-Oithinyaray          = low tide. (lit. become beach).
            :gurrithirri            = coming in, of tide.
            :gunu-bilyunaray gapuy  = at the tum of the tide, about to come in.
            dhapa-gulkthunaraygapuy =at the tum of the tide, about to recede.

            The Stars.

            Only a small number of stars or constellations appear to be named, and

all of those for which I found names have either ritual or mythological significance.

In amongst the terms listed earlier, associated with the classifications of time at

night were a set of terms for events relating to the morning star. There being three

successive morning stars, their separate risings and their disappearance are used as

temporal locations during the pre-dawn morning. One term was also included in

the same lists based on the setting of the evening star.


            The Milley Way, bagurru, always visible in some part of the night sky,

was the source of only one of the terms I collected, bagurru-bilyunaray (lit.the

milky way is turning fjust passing zenith]) was only relevant at some times of the

year, however I was told in English by one person that "we know the time at night

by the position of bagurru.".

            Indication was given that the Pleiades and Orion's Belt (which together

form the constellation djul_pan) are known to be in the sky at the time when root

foods in the bush are becoming available. Similarly djurrplJ!1 (the Evening Star)

was known to indicate that riikay (swamp rush corms) were ready and gurrumaflji

(pied goose) could be hunted and their eggs gathered.


            Repeating events relating to plants.


            In Table 6.4, there were three terms, derived from the development of

yam plants, listed as forming successive parts of the season migawarr. It was the

changes in the plant's appearance, associated with slight changes in the winds

which are the indicators of the different categories. The three terms as I was given

them and as they are in the table are in the form of temporal classifications and not

simply descriptions of plant conditions.


As shown in Table 6.4, it is known which fruits, root foods and flowers are in

evidence when, and Table 6.5 (developed from Rudder 1977. 2:2.3.3.) gives an

indication of the known availability of root foods in three different ecological

zones, showing that most root foods are available for only a limited part of the

year. While it would be a simple matter to refer to "wattle time" or "mango time", it

appears that the plant growth stages function more as indicators of which season is

manifesting and form then part of the qualitative attributes of the different seasons.

Nowhere have I yet found classifications of temporal locations based on plant

development stages alone apart from the three terms shown in migawarr in

Table. 6.4. although temporal locations are often given for other events on the basis

of concurrent plant growth stages.


      Incorporations and Changes since Western Contact.

            Both the Western time system and Western culture have had an impact

on the perceptions of time in Arnhem Land. This can be seen particularly clearly in

terms of increases in vocabulary, through the adaptation of English words to a

Yol:gu phonology, and through the development of new terms to meet cll,anged

social conditions. There has also been some change wrought in the meanings of a

small amount of the original Yol:gu vocabulary when this is used in a non-Yol:gu

context.


            One group of introduced words is the set of names of the days of the

week, which simply adds another sequence of named temporal locations. The

pronunciation of these is severely affected by the fact that there are no fricative

sounds in Yol:gu languages. As a result of this, and the use of the Yol:gu practical

orthography, the names of the days of the week are then as follows,

            Djandi                   =Sunday             Mandi        =Monday
            Djutjthi                 =Tuesday            Winitjthi    =Wednesday
            NambatuBrayti.           =Thursday           Brayti.      =Friday
            Djatati.                 =Saturday.


            Weeks are now also recognised and alternative weeks are identified

according to whether there is an income that week or not. This is related to whether

it is the fortnight when government cheques arrive or not or whether it is council

pay week or not, and the identification can vary from person to person. One elderly

Djapu lady, speaking to family on the telephone beside me, contrasted djirripimirriy

(pension-having time) with gawundjilwikthu (lit. council-week time). That is she

was making a contrast between the week when council .workers were paid and the

alternative week when pensions arrived. Others contrast biny'tjinmirriy (lit.

pension-having time) or gunda-gurrupanamirriy weyikthu (lit.stone/coin-giving-

having-time week) with mayala weyikthu (lit.empty week time). Ross (pre-1977)

notes that at Yirrkala, the wordgumurru-Ouy(lit. big-from-time) was being used

there for "week", and from this had developed a contrast between dhiy81}u

gumurru1Juy (this week) and wirip11-0uy gumurru1Juy (next, or another week).

                                                             Chapter 6. Yolnu Time.




            A small amount of Yolgu vocabulary has absorbed meanings from the

context of their nearest English equivalents. Walu (sun) has been adapted more

than other words discussed in this chapter. Its meaning has now been extended to

include "watch", "clock" and "time" in a Western sense. The question can then be

asked "Nha walu?" (What's the time) with the expectation that the answer will

identify the present time in hours and minutes. The question itself seems to have

developed out of the Western requirement to know what the time is, as there is no

likelihood of any Yoluu not knowing which section of the twenty-four hour cycle

he was in. Any person has only to look around them to know. The question word

"Nhiith.a?' (When?) is used to inquire about non-present time slots.


            The Yoluu word vaJindi has similarly become extended to include the

meaning "month". The question "Nhii{}alindi "(lit. What moon?) has the

expectation of an English answer in the form of the .name of one of the months.

Until Western contact the YolJJu did not name the months separately and it appears

reasonable to assume that these changes have occurred as a result of white

members of the community trying to discover the answers to questions of

importance to them, but irrelevant to the YolJJu in any other context.


            One other effect of the result of government (including school and

hospital) records has been the development of an awareness of dates of birth, and

most adults, even if not sure of their own, know that they have one. With the

advent of white families and the birthday parties for their children to which YolJJu

children were invited, there have now also begun to be Y oluu families celebrating

their own children's birthdays with parties. There is also some awareness that age,

counted by years, is one way of marking the stages in the passage of human life.

                                             Later on he/she will return.

                                             263

four different verb forms (her primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary) and, by

the use of the particles dhu (with future) and ga (with present). She identifies them
by the following terms: present tense, same day past and same day future,

tomorrow future (which includes any specified future time), yesterday past (which

includes any specifically identified past event), and finally far distant past and far

distant future. Examples of the uses of these seven tenses are asJn Table 6.6.


             When these "tenses" are examined more closely it can be shown that

her "same day past" and "far distant past" tenses are identical. Similarly the "same

day future" and "far distant future" tenses are also the same as each other. The

distinctions being made by the use of these forms cannot then be argued to be

related solely to the distance in time from the present. What the contrasts do

indicate is a distinction being made between precise and non-precise locations of

the event (in relation to the repeating temporal locations) and between actual

(present and past) and potential (future) actions. The continuative particle is

obligatory in the present, and optional at any other time. In Gupapuyiju usage then,

in the description of any actual (past or present) event in a precisely identified

location in time, the primary form of the verb is used (with the continuative particle

ga, if it was an event which involved duration, and the primary form without any
particle if there is no duration indicated, i.e. it is "simple past tense"). For an actual

event where there is no identification of a precise location, the tertiary form of the

verb is used,and for duration of action, the particle gana (a derivative of ga) is

added. With potential (future) actions, the same contrast is apparent between events

where time location was specified (tomorrow future) and events where the time

classification was not given (same day, and distant future).


             My suggestion then is that while there are two contrasts used in the

Gupapuyiju verbs which are related to location in temporal space, neither contrast

is concerned with the distance of time from the present One is a contrast between

precise and imprecise temporal locations, and the other is a contrast between actual
(i.e.the event exists in both space and time) and potential (can come into existence,
but hasn't yet). This in turn indicates the importance to the Yo~u two types of
contrast.

            My analysis of the verb forms is illustrated in Table 6.7,, The two
levels of the figure are significant, particularly in regard to understanding usage and
its perceptual framework. They also give some indication of the low level of
importance placed on precision in locating events in time.

            The upper level of the figure is concerned with the normal, everyday
useage of the language. It shows first a contrast between present, (and hence a
definite temporal location). and non-present indefinite location. Secondly there is a
contrast shown between events which are future and hence potential, and those
which are present or past and hence have become actuated.

            The lower level of the figure illustrates what happens when the
temporal location of a non-present event has significance. When this happens, a
definite temporal location is given and the action, whether actual or potential, is
referred to using a different verb form from that used for an indefinite location.

location. One set of four terms refers to the four spatial locations in present time,

and the other set to the same set of spatial location in non-present time. The latter

set retain the same form whether the temporal location is precisely determined or

not and whether it is actual or potential. I have included in the figure examples from

both Djambarrpu~u and Gupapu~u languages as an indication that these same

contrasts are probably consistent across a number of languages among the YolIJu

peopleslO.

as "derived words, adverbs of time", saying that these are developed by the

addition of the instrument/action suffix-dhu, -thu, -yu, -y.11 Some of these are

described as being constructed from verbs. For example, bo.ggama =break (of

day), becomes bo.gganharay =at day break, at dawn, by the addition of an action or

instrument suffix (-y) to the quaternary form of the verb (bo.gganha +ra). Similarly

.gurru-bilyunaraygapuy (at the tum of the tide about to come in) is derived in literal
terms from, nose-tuming+(-y) water+(-y). A larger selection of derived terms of

both these types is included in Tables 6.1 and 6.2. In this way time expressions can

be developed from the nominalised form of the verb with the "instrument/action"

suffix added to produce a name for a temporal location.


              In the list of terms given earlier, and the accompanying Figures 6.1 and

6.3, there is a combination of what appear to be descriptive terms and terms that

have been listed as temporal locations. These are recorded as they were collected

during discussions of the cycles of the day and the seasons. As they were spoken

out, they were in this mixture of forms. It appears that when the particular period is

being discussed it will be given its name or descriptive term, but when this is used

as a specific reference to the time location when some other event occurs, the -y

suffix is used, to indicate that that is the temporal location.

                                             Terms.

              There are some temporal locations that are classified by names that are

not developed by descriptive means and there are a variety of others that have been

developed as qualitative descriptions. Examples of the former are found in Lowe

(N.D:Lesson 81) in a list of words which she describes as "pure adverbs of time"

as follows,




11 The form of the suffix used is relative to the final sound of the word to which it is attached. If
the word ends in a vowel the suffix is "-y".

                         baipuru         =yesterday
                         giithura        =today, just now,
                         gajaJT'         =morning, in the morning
                         gug_burrku      = in the middle of the night, late at night,
                         yalala          =later on,


             Her list is not exhaustive, and many other such words have already

been listed earlier in this chapter. In the preceding section I showed how a

distinction can be made between the form of words used as names for temporal

locations, and their form when used with the -dhu, -thu-, -yu, -y, suffix to indicate

location of another event in conjunction with them. In other cases, use may be

made of some feature of the period during which an action occurs, like the name of

the wind which is blowing, such as biirra, the west wind. To this is then added the

suffix -mirri (having or possessing) to produce a qualitative expression so that

 biirra becomes biirramirri (having the west wind). With the addition of the
additional suffix -y this then becomes the name of one of the seasons, Biirramirriy

(at the period having the west wind) or an event locating term. A number of such

. terms have already been listed which incorporate the suffix, -mirri, and there

appears to be no limit for the potential use of this construction. For example,

"during the wet season" can be waltjlJ!l.mirriy (at the period rain-having) and "at

Christmas" is now Chri.stmasmirriy (at the period Christmas-having).


             When the name for a temporal location is combined with a

demonstrative or developed from a demonstrative by using the -dhu, -thu-, -yu, -y,

suffix, such expressions are developed as,

                                dhiyariu bala waluy      = this day I now.

                                dhiyariu waltjagdhu      = this year I wet season

                                wiripuvuy waluy          =another day.

             The use of such expressions is discussed in the next section.

                                                                Chapter 6. Yolnu Time.


   DISTANCE IN TEMPORAL SPACE.

            Distance in temporal space is indicated not by referring to a

measurement of time, but to the location in temporal space of the event under

discussion. This as I have shown up to this point is achieved in a number of ways.

These included the identification of locations contained in specific classifications, a

number of terms that indicate proximity or absence in temporal space, and a

contrast was shown in the demonstratives, which lies between present and non-

present locations, and finally a contrast was demonstrated in the verbs between

precise and non-precise location of events. I move now to the consideration of

terminology associated more strictly with distance from the present.


            In the preceding section I noted the terms barpuro (yesterday), giithura

(today), gajarr(in the morning/tomorrow) and yalala (later) without making

comment that these are not so much references to location in the relation to

repeating temporal events, as to location relative to today. None of them, apart from

giithura, is used to refer strictly to an exact location but to a generalisation of

within a day (or other category) or two. Other terms referring to position relative to

the present are developed by using the demonstratives, "this" and "other" in

conjunction with time location terms. For example, dhiyaf)u bala waluy (this day I

now), dhiyaf)u waltjafl.dhu (this year I wet season) andwiripuyuy waluy(another

day). These are used at both the level of the day's events and at the level of the

seasons to extend the locations beyond the current event.


            Two sets of terms are associated with distance from the present,

developed from the words galki (close) and barrku (far) using the modifiers miirr

(moderately) and mirithirri. (extremely) and all of the terms used are relative ones.

These are used to refer to distance in either geographic or temporal space, forming

sets of terms such as, galki (close/soon), miirr galki (fairly soon/fairly close) and

mirithirrgalki very close/very soon). The second set, referring to specifically to


                                           269
                                                              Chapter 6. Yolnu Time.

events of the near past can be referred to as barpuru (yesterday or yesterdayish)
mlirr barpuru (moderately yesterday/in the last few days) (Buchanan 1991).

Alternatively the events can be treated as either, being in imprecise temporal
locations, or else located using one of the words from the sets of repeating terms.

            Beyond the distance able to be referred to by these terms an event is
located by one of three methods. The first of these uses the terms for imprecise far
distance in time, baman'(long ago) or baman'birr'(extremely long ago). The
second method allocates an event as being in relation to one of a series of events of
major significance in either historical or religious terms, or a combination of the
two. These, not listed in strict sequence, are as follows,

               Ma,ugatharramirriy =during the time that the Macassans came on
                                    regular visits.
               Womirriy           =during World War II
               Mitjinmirriy       =during the time when the Arnhem Land
                                    towns were missions staffed by
                                    missionaries.
               Revivalmirriy      = during the initial period of the Arnhem Land
                                    Revival, or at one of the subsequent Annual
                                    Revival Thanksgiving rallies.

            It appears possible to also speak of events as being concurrent with the
journeys of the ancestral beings. For example they could be spoken of as
concurrent with the time of the Dja,u'kawu or the Wawilak, or of Barama and
Lany'tjun, and both Morphy (1984: 17) and Williams (1986:28) refer to a sort of
location in the distant past which was Waua,rr (Creative Ancestor) time which these
authors consider as being a sort of creation period into which all these creative
beings have been incorporated. I made no record of any reference to such an
overall category, but there would be no difficulty in using such a term and no
conflict between it and my own observations, as it is with this connotation that I
have observed the two terms for imprecise far distance in time being used.



                                          270
                                                                     Chapter 6. Yohlu Time.


              The third method which can be used to locate events at a distance
relates an event to the history of individuals. This could be a reference to something
that happened during the life of a living person or of a deceased relative. It can
simply be a reference to that person's lifetime as a whole, as for example, I was told
that the miilk (subsection) system was brought to the coastal people by a man's
grandfather when the same man brought the Gunapipi ceremony. Alternatively, a
reference may be made to an event occurring at or after a significant ceremonial
event in a person's lifetime. For example, a man may speak of his seeing certain
items first at his circumcision ceremony.u

              There is in the use of such life stage categories to locate events, the
awareness that there is a succession of temporal locations, but it is the location of
events in relation to the life stages which appears to be the focus of attention, with
the distance from the present a peripheral aspect of the location, and the continuum
aspect of time, irrelevant.

              When each of the sets of terms and the different approaches to temporal
locations are juxtaposed on a graph which represents a continuum, some interesting
aspects become apparent. Figure 6.3 gives an indication of the kinds of location
that can be relevant in the succession of events in a family's history. In this figure
the word .yunhi has been rendered as "when", but could equally be rendered as
"where" or as "at that space" (As shown in Table 6.8). This appears to be unlikely
for such a sequence of events to be extended more than one generation into the
future or more than two into the past, so that the precise location of events in

temporal distance is relevant in this context within the period of living memory, but
beyond that is irrelevant and hence imprecise. Occasionally an event will be said to
have occurred during the lifetime of the founder of a clan, however this is not
common, and when it does occur, it belongs to the mythological end of the

12 Geertz (1966:420) claims that how one views the process of biological aging profoundly
affects how one experiences time, suggesting that there is an unbreakable link between the
"conception of what it is to be a person and their conception of the structure of history"

continuum rather than being a reference to a precise location. In terms of the future
there is at most the possibility of potential location one generation ahead.

            Figure 6.4 shows that the potential for locating events with precision in
terms of seasons is limited to the current year and to the season with the same name
in either the previous or the following year. Beyond that there is really only
capacity for imprecision in time allocation. If the term dh11-0garra (year) is used,
events can still only be allocated to this year or other year and beyond that again
events can only be imprecisely located. This same pattern applies to the allocation
of events to particular days. As shown in Figure 6.5 even if the terms for
yesterday, today and tomorrow were able to be used with precision, accurate
location of time on a day's scale is available only within the central three days of the
time scale and beyond that events are imprecisely located.

            Whichever of the repeating temporal location systems are used, it
appears that there is potential only for the accurate location of events in relation to
the current repeating event, or the adjacent ones. Beyond that only imprecise
location of events is possible. If the use of the three "number" terms becomes
incorporated, the pattern can be extended a little, but in principle remains limited in
the same way. That is, events can be located in relation to the present, precisely for
a short space on either side of the present, and then beyond that only with
imprecision.

            One final problem which remains for consideration is that associated
with the location of mythological events which, while presented as having occurred
in a far distant past, nevertheless have about them a quality that places them also in
the "present". These are the events that are often referred to as occurring during
''The Dreaming" (e.g. Stanner 1956 and Morphy 1990) or during the "Dreamtime"
(e.g. Morphy 1990 and Tonkinson 1974).

            When stories of such mythological events are being told by the Yol:gu,
the verbs that are used in the narration appear to inevitably be in the "indefinite
past" form, although the geographic location is usually very precisely given. This
supports a view that it is the reality of the event and its power which is of
significance and not the time of its occurrence. If a YoI:ou person is pressed with
questions concerning when an event occurred, the answer will usually be given
using the terms for imprecise far distance, baman' (long ago) or baman' birr'
(extremely long ago) or occasionally the word barrku (far) will be used in the place
of baman' In terms of temporal distance this may refer to an event as close as
within the present lifespan, but appears to be frequently interpreted by English
speakers as being "during the dreamtime".

            I have recorded one such a story couched in mythological terms and
given an indefinite temporal location, which appeared to describe events that



                                               274
                                                               Chapter 6. Yoh1u Time.

occurred in 1942. On the assumption that this is a reasonable interpretation of the
story that I was told it would support strongly the fact that in the narration of myth
and in the location of mythological events, time is irrelevant and that an event's
relationship to the "inside" reality is what is significant.

             Morphy (1990:314) argues however that there are two distinct
categories of myth which he terms myths of creation and myths of inheritance. He
sets these in different time frames, arguing that the latter describe events which
occurred in an intermediate time frame between the events of creation and those of
the present. The myth to which I am referring would, I suspect, be one that he
would describe as a myth of inheritance. I have no argument with his classification
of two kinds of myth, but suggest that the Yoluu, in telling them, do not set them in
different time frames, as the time frame, while it may be recognised by the Yoluu
is, as I have just suggested, treated by them as being irrelevant.

             I have argued also in an earlier chapter that the type of myth described
by Morphy as a myth of creation, appears to be concerned with the creation of the
sacredness of some element of the landscape, or the creation of sacred objects that
are frequently in the form of natural species. It is not the timing of such an event
which is important, but its reality, its power and its geographic setting. This second
kind of myth is therefore not concerned with the creation of geographic features at
all but with the revelation of their sacredness, couched in the terminology of
creation. My argument here is that something altogether different from a time
setting is involved in both of the kinds of myths classified by Morphy.

             As I have shown in earlier chapters, the events described in mythical
terms can be considered as "outside" or public stories, each of which has
analogically carried meanings that refer to things of an "inside" private, secret, or
sacred nature. These narratives then are concerned with events thought of as having
to do with the unchanging "inside" reality, its identification, expression or



                                            275
                                                                  Chapter 6. Yolnu Time.

revelation. Because this is unchanging, time is irrelevant, and could even be argued
to be non-existent where these events are concerned. Such an event when it occurs
is simply an "outside" manifestation of something beyond time. The Yo~u
philosophy of changelessness is nowhere more active than in such a situation. The
description of such an event is then the description of an event of a totally different
kind from everyday actions, usually anchored to a particular location but having to
do with reality, not time and it is the location of the event geographically and in
relation to the "inside" which is significant. Any emphasis of distance then
becomes an emphasis on significance, authority and power, not its temporal
location. If one can draw a distinction between "eternal" as qualitative and
"everlasting" as quantitative evaluations of time, then the YolIJu have focussed on
eternal time as expressing that quality or state of existence which is real but
timeless. It is this distinction that Stanner (1972:267-277) has sought to make with
his use of the term "the everywhen", and of "the Dreaming" in contrast to "the
Dreamtime".

   CONCLUSION.

            I have sought in this chapter to consider the contrasts between the
Yoluu conceptualisation of and approach to temporal location, and some of the
more general aspects of Western perceptions of time. Three different types of
location have been identified in the process of discussion; locations related to
repeating events, location of events in relationship to the transformations occurring
during the lifetime of humans, plants or animals, and finally location of events of
mythological significance in relation to the inside of reality.

            Repeating events as I have described them are concerned with those
events which occur in regularly repeating sequences such as periods of the day,
seasons of the year, and movements of the moon, stars and tides. I have shown that
the Yo]-Ou use these to express two separate aspects of time. First to locate an event

                                                                Chapter 6. Yol:nu Time.

in relation to a section of the current sequence, or the sequence on either side of it,
or to locate an event imprecisely as "the other .... " (day, season, tide, etc.). The
second aspect of this is that used in this way, the same locating gives an indication
of distance from the present. However, as indicated in the discussion of Figures
6.8 and 6.9, both location and distance are only precise in the current sequence,
approximate in the sequences either side, and totally imprecise beyond that.

             Yo4Ju basically classify out the continuum time by establishing the
location of an event as occurring in relation to one of the sets of repeating
sequential events as described above, or in relation to a particular stage in the life of
a known person. The continuum of time is almost totally irrelevant and I have
suggested that beyond two generations there is little likelihood of the precise
location of any event. All events beyond such precise location are treated as
occurring in what I have described as "indefinite time". Within past "indefinite"
time I have shown that there have been a number of major epochs established, such
asMa:ogatharramirriy and Womirriy. The sequential relationship between these
epochs becomes increasingly blurred the more distant they become from living
memory. One result of this is that the more distant any epoch becomes, the more it
tends to overlap into the third type of time, that is mythological time.

             I have argued that events seen as having mythical or historical
significance are not in fact given a temporal classification or a location in distance at
all, other than "far distant". These, and events beyond living memory but still
retained as part of the Yo4Ju corporate experience, go through a change. They
become transformed to a qualitative state of unchanging existence that can best be
described as eternal, in contrast to everlasting.

             Because of the Yo4Ju focus on location of events in temporal space as
opposed to any consideration of a continuum of time, such events, although they
retain some flavour of having occurred in the past, become located in a different

                                                                Chapter 6. Y ol:nu Time.

 reality. I have argued in earlier chapters that events of this kind are seen by the

 Yol:ou as part of the unchanging inside of reality. That which has been experienced

 by them, being though of as having gone back to what the Y ol:ou describe as

 djinawa (inside). Because it is common to ref~r to this "inside" as inside water, or
 inside the earth, (where a body is put at death when the person goes inside after

 death), it is common for such an interpretation to be spoken of as if it was a literal

 place and each group has its own clan site as the focus of this entry point. For

 example (Morphy 1990.314) refers to a Yol:ou model of the ancestral beings

 returning into the ground and of a relationship between humans, "and beings of the

 ancestral 'past' and of the below-the-ground present".


             If my argument is correct, the YoI:ou are not speaking of a physical

 location at all, but using the physical as an analogue of a spiritual reality, although

 these are, as mentioned above, given a physical location. This being so, events of a

 mythological nature, irrespective of their antiquity, almost completely cease to be

· events in time at all. By becoming part of the inside, they are then part of the

 unchanging eternal which is past, present and future. Having been expressed once

 physically gives the event a location in "indefinite" temporal space and precise

 geographic space, but having become part of the mythological inner reality it is also

 timeless. It is from this that the ambiguous quality of such events arises and it is

 this that has resulted in the white Australian's mystical concept of "The

 Dreamtime".

   BANUMBIRR : THE COSMOS PORTRAYED.
   INTRODUCTION.

             There is as I have shown in the previous chapters a great complexity and
diversity in the YoJuu portrayal of the Cosmos. There are many ceremonial
complexes, and an apparent multiplicity of messages being communicated through the
various forms used. I have very briefly indicated that there are in any such complex,
messages communicated about such primary concerns as the nature of man, the nature
of the world, sexuality, life, procreation birth and death. There are also portrayed
within any complex, connections between clans and land, relationships between clans,

links to other ceremonial complexes, and with all these are discriminations which
reinforce the individual identities of clans, and corporately held elements that
emphasise group solidarity. I have argued that through all these it is the nature of
information held in analogue that enables the release or restriction of the flow of
knowledge, and that it is also through the information held in analogue that messages
about the nature of the cosmos are communicated. In this chapter and in the
Conclusion I examine one such ceremonial complex. That is the one associated with
the Morning Starl. In this examination I will demonstrate some of the ways in which
information is carried, connections are made, transformations and analogues function
and the Cosmos itself is portrayed.

             Banumbirr is the name given to the Morning Star that rises from the east
in the last stages of night before dawn. It is also the name given to the whole complex
network of myth and ritual, meaning and practice, song-poetry and dance, ideas and
relationships linked to it. This extensive complex is "owned" by many of the clans of
the Dhuwa moiety and spreads over almost the entire north-eastern section of Arnhem
Land.




1The Morning Star is the planet Venus.


                                              279
                                        Chapter 7. Banumbirr : The Cosmos Portrayed.
            In the Elcho Island region and to the east, the Banumbirr complex has as
its focus or core, a small set of facts which appear to be agreed upon by at least some
of the groups of the Y01-0u involved . That is to say, that for some of the Y01-0u at

Elcho there is a corporately accepted core of facts. As one moves out from this focus
(either geographically or intellectually), change can and does occur. Towards the
geographic edges of this region, even some of the facts which have functioned as the
core at Elcho become hazy and begin to change. As ideas and practices are extended
beyond the central core of the complex, the network is extended or moved and
manipulated by a wide range of group-specific ideas and practices.

            The nearest I could come to determining a set of corporately held basic
"facts" that was agreed upon by the Gapiny group of clans is as follows;
                  a. Banumbirr is the Morning Star which rises in the eastern sky
                      before dawn,
                  b. Banumbirr is a made object largely of feathers and string, and in
                     ritual practice Banumbirr may incorporate or be attached to a
                     wooden pole.
                  c. The mokuys at Burralku dance the Banumbirr dance each night
                     before it is released to go on its journey across the sky.
                  d. Banumbirr is attached to a string which controls its outward flight
                     and by which it is drawn back to Burralku.
                  e. In its journey, Banumbirr stops over the territory of each clan
                      which "owns" it.

            These central "facts" identify Banumbirr as Banumbirr, form the focus of
its identity for the Gapiny group, and appear to be fundamental facts assumed as
known when any reference is made to it. The majority of the different groups of

Yoiuu at Galiwin 'ku, with whom I had contact, appeared to accept these "facts",
irrespective of any additional details that a different group might add to them. These
facts thus serve to establish a focus for intergroup agreement and intergroup
relationships. Nevertheless there is no single "true" version of the myth, and each
performance, whether this be of myth, song, painting, dance or the construction of a




                                              280
                                        Chapter 7. Banumbirr : The Cosmos Portrayed.
ceremonial object is, at the time of its production, considered to be correct by those
iesponsible for the performance. It also appears inevitable that some other observers
will criticise details of the performance, usually out of hearing of the performing
group, in ways that demonstrate their own superior knowledge and the performers'
ignorance.

             Corporately agreed upon separate ownership of Banumbirr by different
clans enables each of the owning clans to maintain its relationships with other clans
through the complex, while at the same time affirming its own clan variations. The
"assumed to be commonly held" core of "facts" functions as a basis to which each
separately identified group of people then links their own set of "facts". This pursuit
by smaller groups of ideas and practices that are specifically their own, while related
to the central "facts", serves to maintain the discrete identity of the smaller groups, and
to emphasise that group's particular relationships to other groups and to land and their
superior knowledge. This is done in part by emphasising those aspects of Ba,numbirr
that link it to other elements of the group's discrete and separately maintained
mythological and ritual elements and hence identity, and by the above-mentioned
critical assessment of others.

             While the name "Banumbirr" appears to refer to different things in
different contexts it is perceived as a single identity with a variety of expressions of
that identity. The name then, refers to all expressions simultaneously with only the
context discriminating one meaning from another. So, Ba,numbirr is as mentioned
earlier, the name of a number of different things: the Morning Star that indicates that
daylight is returning, the myths which purport to explain its origins and nature, songs
which tell the same story in Yol:gu poetic form, bark paintings which present these
pictorially, ceremonials which dramatise them, and ritual objects which are seen not as
iepresentations of, but as a transformation of, the star and as transformations of each
other. Each of the linked clans has a slightly different transformation of the various




                                              281
                                           Chapter 7. Banumbirr : The Cosmos Portrayed.

elements of the complex and each clan claims that their version is the correct one with

their particular names for, and transformations of, the items being the focus of their
version of the complex.


               I present fll'St some of the facts of Banumbirr as they are seen by one man

from one clan, Wagaymu, the senior member of the ~aymil clan at Galiwinku. To this
I then add some details supplied by other men from two other closely related clans

(Golumala and Dapwuy) which, together with ~aymil, form what is called Gapiny

mala (group) a small conglomerate of clans which share a number of ceremonial

elements. The name Gapiny for this corporate id~ntity of the three clans appears to be

used by most of the men but there is no total agreement as to its validity. One Dapwuy

senior clan member was quoted to me as saying that it should only be used to refer to

his clan. I use it as it was used by others of the group. Following this discussion of

the Gapiny ideas I broaden the examination of the complex to consider links with

other clans, relationships between Banumbirr and land ownership, variations in

narratives and clan specific transformations together with their significance, and I

leave a more comprehensive analysis of the symbolic content to the final chapter of

this thesis.

   THE :tiAYMIL FOCUS.

               The barest outline of the myth, which contains the earlier listed basic facts,

describes the manufacture of the Morning Star (as a ceremonial object) by a mokuy

(dead person or spirit being). Each day before dawn this star is let out from Burralku

(its place of manufacture) on a string, and at daylight it is hauled back on the string by

a woman who stores it away in her basket where it stays until its next journey.

Different aspects of this myth have been made available to me by clan members.

These include a recorded narrative and details shared during discussion of bark

paintings.




                                                282

              Wagaymu told the .rjaymil clan version of Banumbirr for me on tape.2

The story he tells gives some details of the myth but although the narrative is told as

the outward journey of the star, the focus is on Banumbirr as a ceremonial object, and

concerned with relationships between clans and land. It is a story filled with a

profusion of names and alternative names, and the use of the same names for some

different locations to the extent that the reader can become quite confused. The

paragraphs are numbered only to assist reference to particular aspects of the story3.


       Story of Banumbirr as told by Wadaymu.
             1. Yes the story is about that place Gundalmirri. At Gundalmirri there was
       working that spirit being named Go:u-bi!ma ["Hand-clapstick" or "Always
       Singing"].His other name is YawuI:uura, and the woman's [or his wife's] name
       is Ma!umbu. He was working at that place Gundalmirri making Banumbirr. He
       was singing, and that singing for Banumbirr spoiled his wife's sleep and she
       (Ma!umbu), was crying because of Banumbirr. Her sleep was spoiled and she
       was crying for Banumbirr, for its making4.

             2. All right. Again he cried out sounds while holding it and dancing and
       shaking his arms. Dhanbul did [Djapu name for that Spirit being]. He made
       Banumbirr powerful, put everything on the bone/core [string, feathers and
       paint].When they were all there on it, he played the didgeridoo. He played at the
       place named GundalmirriIJur. [He played the tune] Banumbirr5.

             3.All right. After that it went quickly and crossed the water there at
       Gundalmirri and then it stopped at Burralku. From Burralku it looked and saw
       the place named Mayayikurr and Mayayilka. [That is Biijgurrpi:ugurr Island].

             4. All right. After that it came down, and was travelling through I across
       the water, and came out here at Wakurra Island [A .rjaymil place]. At Wiikurra it
       went up above and saw that place called Mayayikurr, [a Djambarrpuy:uu place]
       and from there it went through the water and came out at Burralku which is
       close to the islands .rjurruyurrtjurrwu}'Uuy and Mayayikurrwuy:uuy near
       Matamata. There he came out at Mayayikurr and they heard the spirit being's
       clapsticks, from that spirit being, from Djambarrpu}'Uu and W altjangu:u
       Wulwulwuu [from the Bottom Djapu clan] .There that spirit being was dancing
       north wind for the Djambarrpu}'Uu people, and there he went up and they saw
       him go past. He went past and then stopped and danced the feathered string
       "Mawuka" [which is a yam] and [that other jungle yam called] "Balajay".
       There they were dancing at Mayayikurr. He, that .rjaymil clan Banumbirrwent



2 He recorded the story in front of his family, but as he said, told it in Djambarrpu)'Uu (not his own
language) so th'1 it would be easier for me to understand.
3 The full vernacular text is found in Appendix F.
4 There were very definite sexual overtones in these last two sentences and at one stage Wajaymu
began to giggle about the subtlety of his choice of ambiguous words.
5 "dancing" and "playing" are euphemisms for "copulating".

past towards Wfilrurra. It went down and went under the water and crossed over
the water and came out here at Burralku, here at this Burralku on Galiwin'ku,
here at the point called Djarraya number two. It came out here. From there he
looked to here. "This is my place, Ruypu, [also called] Milwinditja and
Gawuypu. He went up at Djoniwuy, that's what he said that spirit being named
          11


Banumbirr

       5.At that place he sank down through and went under and came out here
at Djoni (at Galiwin'ku). At the hill at Djoni he went up then saw that place the
small island, come up (above the horizon) and then he looked and saw
l'janga!a!a, Marrwawurrpa (a Djinllij place) that's the specific place name
Marrwawurrpa. He saw Luuurr there. Then he looked and saw that place
Gurripa, [a Gamalaijga place] all of them those islands, that place Gurripa,
Walagaijun, [Gamalaijga country names] That's what he saw, there.

      6.All right, from here at Gawuypu, Ruypu, [Galiwin'ku site names]. He
stopped here. At Ruypu he coloured the bones/core/earth with ratjpa [haematite
iron oxide pigment], Milwinditj Gawuypu [Galiwin'ku alternative names]. Then
he thus [spoke] "Yes you and I here will stay, Gunuwaija [MurruJJun clan
name] andBu!ukmana,Dar'miny, Guwarr'miny, [l'jaymilclannames]
Gondarra [Golumala clan sirname], is separate, but those two only are first,
Bu!ukmana, and this place Gunuwaija. First they two, they two are leaders for
here, Gunuwaija [MurruJJun clan] and Bu!ukmana" [DhuQ.i-l'jaymil clan]. There
he coloured this place with ratjpa [haematite iron oxide pigment] Gawuypu,
Ruypu, Milwinditj, Dhaltha, Gundalmirri, Djirritjirri, Djo~a. ~ikan terms for
NoJJgurr (Gondarra and l'jaymil)]. There from Gundalmirri [close to
Gurrumurru] and here at Gundalmirri [at Elcho].

      7. All right. From here [Galiwin'ku] he looked at that MurruJJga place. He
passed through the water, crossing the water called Mirikindi, Maijaymllijay,
Dhawunuwunu [names for water]. He swam to that place there at MurruJJga. He
was at Wfilagllijur (place near Milingimbi) and then from Wala.Qaijur to
MurruJJga. There he went up. He looked towards LuJJurr, that's the name for the
big area at l'janga!a!a. !:uJJurr is that big place truly. It's truly Luuurr but
Marrawurrpa is the big area there at Marmhala [close to Rramingining]. That
place is Gawuypu [iron oxide like at Galiwin'ku] there.All right.

      8. From here [Galiwin'ku] his arms, went in different directions
Gawuypuy, Marmhalay and he went up and one arm went to Luuurrwuy. His
arm from right side went in a different direction. It named the place
Marrawurrpa, [belonging to Burarra-marawurrpa people] also named Gunini,
Benydjura, Marrawa!wa. This is the story concerning Banumbirr. It concerns
Banumbirr.That's Banumbirr's story.

       9. All right, but it was just the l'jaymil Banumbirr that went. And he
stopped there at Gunini, Benydjura, Marrawal_pa, Marrawa!a there. There he
stopped ijaymil and MurruJJun, ijaymil and MurruJJun. That's MurruJJun
Mti!arra, and MurruJJun Gunbirri. This Banumbirmydja stopped MurruJJun
Mti!arra, and MurruJJun Gunbirri, ijaymil, and from that l'jaymil [place]. And
that [one] he Gu!mannha stopped, Gunini, Benydjura, Marrawurrpa.There is a
pandanus tree standing there. It's the pandanus image (of Banumbirr) there [at
Marrawurrpa].That's the whole of his [details] completed.

            In W a.Qaymu 's story it is explicitly stated that this is a made object,

Banumbirr being made by YawuhJura at the ijaymil clan homeland centre. After

construction, or by means of the process of construction, which appears to be the

inference here, Banumbirr is made powerful. This seems to indicate an imbuing with a

personality, and a life of its own, and by the time the story has reached the end of

Paragraph 4, Banumbirr is spoken of as being a Wagarr(spirit being). After

construction the "made" representation is described as having a wooden core, [a pole]

with arms of tasselled strings, and then throughout the rest of the narrative can be

interpreted as a spiritual entity which by its journey and actions is establishing

relationships between clans. In Paragraph 8 there is indication with the separate travel

of the two arms, that there are two sets of sites and clans linked to Elcho ijaymil by

separate movements of Banumbirr. It is not until the beginning of Paragraph 9 that we

discover that this is a ij aymil Banumbirr and by implication from that, it is not the

only Ba,numbirr that exists, and it is this that partly explains the separate linkages of

clans mentioned in Paragraph 8. They are linked by the separate transferences of

separately constructed objects.


            On its journey this particular Banumbirr, made at the ijaymil place called

Gundalmirri is described as linking together the sites and clans that are identified in

the story. Apart from the great number of place names used in the story, there are

repetitions of some sections. Paragraph 4 is a repetition and extension of Paragraph 3

where the site Wfilrurra had been omitted, and the first part of Paragraph 5 repeats the

last part of Paragraph 4. All told there are thirty-one place names used and some of

these are repeated. In discussion with Wagaymu later, it became apparent that numbers

of the names used were alternative names for single sites, and that some were for

separate small places within a general area. The question can be asked as to why there

are so many names for these places, but the answer appears to be found by

recognising that their use is an example that knowledge is property. In the use of all




                                           285
                                               Chapter 7. Banumbirr : The Cosmos Portrayed.


these names the speaker is giving evidence that not only does he know the story, he

knows and has authority to use the other names, a majority of which appear to be

ceremonial names. The story then becomes not just a recorded narrative, but a tape

recorded document carrying evidence of rights in the land and Wagaymu is using the

making of the tape to make an assertion concerning his own authority in relation to the

local Ba.numbirr site. 6


              When the multiplicity of names is reduced by identifying the actual

locations, there appear to be seven places where Ba.numbirr is said to have stopped.

These are, as they were described by one group of men;

                      Gundalmirri, which is a tjaymil and Dii!iwuy area.

                      Mayayikurr, named as a Djambarrpuy:gu place.

                      Wakurra, a tfaymil place.

                      Djoni, a common name for a site on Elcho Is, said to belong to
                        Murru:gun, tjaymil and Golumala Clans.

                      Murru:gga Island, which is a Murru:gun clan site.

                      Lu:gurr, belonging to Gamala:gga people.

                      Marrwawurrpa, named as belonging to both Djina:g and Burarra
                        people.


              Thus with the movementofBanumbirrthese sites (See Map 7.1.) are said

to be linked together in a relationship based on the shared experience of having the

ceremonial object visit them and with this the simultaneous experience with the spirit

being of the same name. This then becomes re-inforcement for ownership interests in

those sites by the clans related to the sites.


              It should be noted that in Wagaymu's narrative and the separate

discussions I had with him about the bark paintings which now follow, the word




6 By association with that, there is then implied authority over the iron ore deposit on which the town
of Galiwin'ku is built, and following the logical progression from this there are then implied rights to an
authoritative voice in the management of die town.

mokuy (spirit being/deceased person) is used consistently to describe the one who

made Banumbirr. There is however a problem in translating this which I was not able

to totally solve in the time available with him. That is, that it is not possible anywhere

to say that this is definitely used to refer to a spirit being and not to an ancestral

member of the clan who, having died, is therefore a deceased human. The two

interpretations of mokuy are equally true. It is only Banumbirr which is explicitly

termed wayarr(spirit being).


       A bark painting of Banumbirr, by Wadaymu.

              Every painting of Banumbirr by any artist serves to illustrate a particular

emphasis or aspect of the Banumbirr complex. This first painting by Wagaymu (See

Plate 7 .1) together with the different interpretations he gives, again demonstrates

clearly the ways in which meanings can be layered one on top of the other without

them being revealed to the uninitiated. The layering of meanings in such paintings

helps to introduce us to the analogous layering of meanings in the whole complex, but

also helps to reinforce the validity of the paintings themselves as a vehicle of meaning

and as an integral part of the complex.7


              The painting is in the collection made by Groger-Wurm (1973: 112 and

Plate 163)8. Discussion with W ajaymu of aphotograph of it and later of an enlarged

drawing of it, led to the revelation of several layers of meanings in his painting. There

was no conflict with the information he had told Groger-Wurm in 1973, sixteen years

earlier, but over a series of conversations he shared more of the analogously layered

meanings.




7 Again, in the interpretations of the pictorial representations of the Morning Star complex, the clan has
its own part;icular focus associated with the relevance of certain ~ts of the complex to Jljaymil
identity and to the importance of their part in the complex as a whole.
8 This painting was one of a collection of paintings which I, as art/craft supervisor at Yirrkala in 1967,
sold toWurm Tor the National collection. The photograph used in discuSSion was one that I had taken at
that time. The photo in the plate is by courtesy of Margie West of the N.T. Museum, where the painting
is a part of their collection.

              Groger-Wurm recorded this picture as an illustration of the rjaymil

Morning Star at Gundalmiri [Gundalmirri] with the star (Figure 7.1, No 1)

represented as being on the end of a pole. W agaymu told her that the pole of the star is

decorated with alternate sections of painted areas (Nos 2 and 3), feathered down, and

human hair string binding. There are two women shown, Malumbu [Mfilumbu] (at

17) and Jambujambu (at 19). The "dillybag" in which the Morning Star is kept is

shown at the bottom of the picture (No 16) . In the picture there are, superimposed on

the dillybag, three pendants (Nos 13, 14 and 15) attached to the base of the pole.

These were described as yams, the food of the mokuy. Dots on the strings were said

to be the feather down entwined in it.


In my own first discussion with Wagaymu, what he told me demonstrated that the

version of the story he had recorded earlier had identified the visual elements of the

picture in terms of their more openly obvious meanings. The painting was ostensibly a

representation of the Morning Star dancing pole. In the diagram the numbered

elements of the pole, 2 and 3 are painted sections of the wooden pole separated by

banded sections which represent sections of string and feathers. Elements numbered 4

to 15, represent strings attached to the pole, each of which is tipped with a tassel of

feathers. Panel No 17 is of the woman, Mfilumbu, wife(?) of Go:g-bi!ma, crying. He

made no comment to me about the second female figure9. Panel No 18 represents

Go:g-bi!ma, the name used for the mokuy that made the pole, in his role of

continuously singing and playing the clapsticks. The dancing figures in the other

panels are all mokuy and of these the four across the top of the painting (Nos 20 to

24) are the leaders for the ceremonial. There was then no significant difference

between this set of details and the ones he had described to Groger-Wurm.




9 In this investigation I tried to be open to what he thought of as significant to tell me and so did not ask
for details that were not forthcoming.

               In addition to the above meanings for the visual elements, various

elements of the Morning Star pole also represent particular sites that are linked

through the travels of Banumbirr. Those sites represented by the pole and feathered

tassels in this painting were identified during a later discussion with Wagaymu as

follows:

               No 1. Marrawurrpa.        No 2. Murruuga.               No 3. Galiwinku.
               No.4. Djoma:ua.           No 5. Gawurrmuua.             No 6. Yalatawuy.
               No 7. Dhamurruua.         No 8. Birrkpirrkpuy           No 9. ijangajaja.
               No 10. Gurukpuy.          No 11. Djirritjirriwuy.       No 12. Malkurra:ua.
               No 13. ijathuua.          No 14. Lombiua.               No 15. Gugumurrkuwuy.
               No 16. The larger base of the pole, within which are drawn the sites
               numbered 13 - 15, represents the larger site called Gundalmirri.

               When the place names listed by Wagaymu were checked with two other
men they identified these names as follows;

             Djoma:ua, Gawurrmuua, Yalatawuy, and Dhumurruua are all ijaymil
       places at Rorru, a homeland centre being established jointly by Dapwuy and
       ijaymil clans. Lombiua, Gugumurrkuwuy, f'jathuuuwuy, Djirritjirriwuy and
       Guruwukpuy are also ijaymil places at Rorru.
             Birrkpirrkpuy is the name of two places, a Gunbirri Murruuun site at
       Dalmana Island which is part of Galiwin'ku and also a ijaymil site at Rorru.
       Birrkpirrk is the name of a bird which announces the new arrivals at
       Burralku.10
             Marrawurrpa is a Liya-gawumirr place close to Garriyak.11
             Malkurra:ua was not known.
             Murruuga Island is a Murruuun Mfilarra site close to Milingimbi.


               This means that the list of names given by W ajaymu for the sites were not

an exhaustive list of the different territories linked to Banumbirr, but focussed mostly

on ijaymil sites and added one or two others that were linked reasonably closely.


               A third complete set of meanings made available on a different occasion

focusses on the pole with its attached tassels as being a representation of the yam



10 (also Groger-Wunn pl 10). When the suffix -puy(pertaining to, concerning, associated with) is
added to the bird's name it fonns a name for the locatJ.on which then means" Associated with
Birrkpirrk".
11 Wagaymu in discussing the narrative version of the myth identified this as a place belonging to the
Burarra people and it can easily be the name of two distinct places.


                                                292

plant, gu}'Va (Ipeomea graminea). The central pole is the main stem of the plant. The

feathered tassels No 4 to No 12 are flowering branches of the vine, the three pendants

Nos 13, 14 and 15, are its roots, the yams, which are growing down into the earth

(represented here by the "basket").


              There are then at a minimum, three completely different sets of meanings

available from this painting, each being contained in a different set of visual analogical

references.12 One other transformation which Wagaymu had described to me earlier,

and which is of major significance to the :rjaymil and some of the other clans. That is

the transformation to Warrukay (the barracouta).


       The Story of the Fish, Warrukay. Multiple Meanings.

              When I first began to manage the art/craft business at Yirrkala in 1967 it

was the practice to write up the story of each bark and to glue it on the back of the

painting as this increased sales. One of the painters from the :rjaymil Clan brought in a

· small painting of the fish W arrukay. The story I was told to accompany the picture

was something like this.

             This is the fish Warrukay. It is the Barracouta. This fish swims from the
       salt water to the fresh water and back again. The lines of spots are the bubbles
       that come to the surface as it swims and cleans its teeth.


              Some twelve months later Wagaymu brought in a second painting of the

same fish. Having learned that many of the paintings that looked like representations

of natural species were pictures of ritual objects I asked him, "When you make this

what does it look like?" His reply then was in terms of the use ofWarrukay as a ritual

object.

              We make it out of a hollow tree like that, (indicating a pole about 20 feet
       high), and we carve those two long points with the teeth. They are the jaws of
       the fish. It is a wooden ranga (sacred object). We dance with it before we stand



 12 These however are only the meanings explained during brief discussions with Wajaymu and do not
in any way ex~aust the potenti?l of the painting, nor do they give more than a hint of the broad spectrum
 of transformauons of Banumbm.

      it up and we dance it from the salt water people to the fresh water people and
      back again, and we put the painted bones of the dead person into the hollow
      after they have been carried round for two years in a small container.


              These two stories are quite different yet there are analogous relations

between parts of them. What was, in the first version, fish swimming, is fish

sculpture being danced in the second. Movement from salt water to fresh water in the

first, is movement between salt water and fresh water people. That is those who have

their sacred country on the sea coast, and those who have their sacred country further

inland in fresh water


              Years later, in discussing a photograph of a similar painting of his with

Wagaymu (Plate 7 .2.) he shared the following details, using an alternative name

Murukula for the figure in the painting. This time his focus was on the symbolic

interpretations of features of the painting rather than on the actions of the fish or its

use in ceremony. In this version I discovered for the first time that the barracouta was

a transformation of the Morning Star. The fish's body is a transformation of the pole

of the star as described in the first narrative and illustrated in the painting collected by

Groger-Wurm.

              Murukula 13, the ancestral being of the tiaymil, he brought ratjpa
       (haematite red ochre) to Elcho and Dalmana from Gundalmirri and then he
       changed and became Murruuun. That red painted part on the head is that place
       Gundalmirri. The long yellow stripe along the body is gupumbu (the backbone),
       the black stripes are the skin, and the red and yellow lines across the body at the
       arms (fins) are where we join on the Banumbirr (Morning Star) string, three
       strings on each side, and the long spotted lines on both sides are the morning
       star string.


              These three interpretations of the W arrukay pictures form yet another

perfect example of the ways in which information concerning any similar sectional

network within the Yoluu Cosmos can be restricted or expanded according to

contextual requirements. Whether the first man told me the simplified story because I

was just beginning to learn from the men about their stories or whether he was not

senior enough to relate the more important version is an unanswerable question. There

could be a number of reasons. The point is that there are potentially many versions.

One at least of these is elementary and gives no clue as to the depths of meaning that

really exist, and no indication of the amount of symbolism that is included for those

who can interpret. The second describes the practical use very briefly, and the third

introduces symbolism. In addition to the above I was, at a different time, told by

another ijaymil man that W arrukay was left at the Gundalmirri site by the Dj~'kawu,

and that in paintings it is shown hiding under the water weed called darra. In Plate 7 .2

this is represented by the diagonal (yellow) lines of the background pattern.


            To this point I have introduced the Morning Star as seen by one clan, and

mostly as through the eyes of one man. There have been shown three different

transformations of the star; its ceremonial form, the yam, and the barracouta. Each

transformation is both a discrete identity in its own right, and simultaneously each is

an expression of the single focus of identity which in this case is named Banumbirr.

In the sections which follow I will first discuss extensions to this complex as they

relate to other clans of the Gapiny group and then examine some of the ways the

complex extends to the edges of Y ol:uu territory and beyond.

   THE GAPINY GROUP'S PERSPECTIVE.

            The Gapiny group is composed of three clans; Da!iwuy, Golumala and

ijaymil, who are established as a group on the basis of shared, though different rights

is sites and sacred objects which focus on Banumbirr in different ways. The three

clans have gained very different degrees of power and prestige in the Galiwin'ku

community and this appears to have been related to choices that were made in the past

by the senior men. Of the three clans, Da!;iwuy, led by Muwarra, have continued to be

a very traditionally oriented group, with the men spending most of their time living on

their homeland centre at Rorru, although Muwarra has married daughters living at

both Yirrkala and Galiwin'ku. The ijaymil at Galiwin'ku, Wagaymu's family,



                                         296

normally joined in any major Christian events, but at the same time Wajaymu acted as

one of the ritual leaders in most traditional ceremonies in the town 14. The Golumala

clan, are mostly the descendents ofWili Walalipa 15, one of the two leaders who came

from Milingimbi with Harold Shepherdson with the express purpose of founding the

then, new mission, which is now Galiwin'ku township. Wili, like Muwarra and

Wajaymu was a ritual leader, but unlike them he ensured that his children got the best

Western education they could. His sons have maintained their ritual status and

involvement, although perhaps not with their father's seniority. In contrast they have

taken a leading role in the Christian church and in the community. One of Wili's sons

is an ordained minister in the Uniting Church, was the minister who led the church at

Galiwin'ku during the Revival, and has subsequently been both Moderator of the

Northern Synod of the Uniting Church, and Chairman of the Aboriginal and Islander

Congress of the U.C.A. and is now a member of the central committee of the World

Council of Churches. One of Wili's other sons is a preacher and elder in the local

parish and one of the grandsons has begun training for ordination. One daughter is an

elder in the church and simultaneously the Principal at Shepherdson College, the

school at Galiwin'ku.


             As a public indication of the Golumala clan's commitment to Christ there

was in the church building a painting of the cross of Christ with a barracouta on either

side of the cross (See Plate 7.3). The notes I made of the comments made by one

Golumala man concerning it read as follows,

             That painting in the church with the two warrukay and gapu. Two guya
      (fish) represent yiitjkurru yolrJu. (lit. bad people =two thieves on each side of the
      cross). Use them because they are our totem. White colour on side represent
      white gapu (waves) (Dhuwa gapu) Red rocks in comers represent the red
      gunda (rock) here. The round ones in hole where warrukay (barracouta) live and
      swim through. Might be just rock or animal or story now (without meaning).
      Who know.




14 Wa.Qaymu and his wife and two eldest children moved to Maningrida in the middle of my 1989 field
workbefore we could carry the above discussions any further and I had no later contact with him.

              When we giving something to the church why sacrifice and giving totems

to church instead of changing heart and being living sacrifice. Yesterday's story,

              [Dauatl4Ja preached on the previous day] it's the person that has to change,
        not the things we make with our hands. He's talking about the person. That's
        thinking story but deeper meaning is more to deal.


               On a different occasion he referred to the nature of his clan as barracouta,

emphasising the negative aspects of the fish and hence the clan members, as it was

prior to their meeting with Jesus. They were "just like those criminals". The second

paragraph above was made to emphasise an interpretation which referred to the

painting as representing giving not just the totem (Warrukay) but themselves (as

Warrukay) to God and that without the latter, the giving of the totem was of no value.


              Thus in the Gapiny conglomerate, while all have maintained their focus on

traditional religious practices and lifestyle to some extent, between them these three

clans have taken as wide a spread of approaches to change as could be expected to be

found anywhere in North East Arnhem Land. One clan is very strongly traditional in

their religion and life style, living mostly at their homeland centre, one is strongly

oriented to things Christian and Western 16 and one is ambivalent, attempting to

follow both directions simultaneously and gain advantages from both. The

relationships between the three clans and between them and others were described for

me in various ways using Banumbirr transforms as analogues of the relationships and

it is these on which I now focus. Some of these were discussed in Chapter 4 where I

quoted Dauat14Ja's use of the yam as a model of relationships and of the growth of the

clan.


              Over a period of time all three of the Gapiny clans have attempted in

different ways to establish their rights in the Galiwin'ku town area on the basis of the

Morning Star complex and its various elements.


16 Of the three,1 had very little contact with the .QAP,wuy clan, largely because they spent most their time
at their homeland during my time at Elcho.

        Banumbirr and Title Claims.

              When the second hospital was built at Galiwin'ku, the original building
 became the craft room. At the time when I first took over the management of the men's

craft I noticed that there was an old weathered carving of a fish (later identified as a

 barracouta) nailed over the door. At that time I mistakenly assumed it was advertising
 the building as a craft centre. Years later (1981) when I first saw the present (third)
 hospital, I noticed there was a painting of the same fish nailed over the main entrance.
 (See Plates 7.4 and 7.5). In 1989, that painting was gone. I mentioned this to one of
the Golumala men, who was at the time running a fishing business. He explained that
it was a barracouta that his father had painted, and that after his father died, he brought
it home and nailed it up in the fish room. It was to him like having something of his
father's identity there.

              He allowed me to photograph the painting in its new location and
explained something that I had not paid attention to before. While the centre of the
· painting is a naturalistic representation of the fish, along the edges of the painting were
two long thin transformations of the fish that represented the Barracouta as the pole of
the Morning Star. Along the sides of these were sections marked off with painted
stripes representing sections of the poles decorated with feathers and string, and

between these striped sections were painted the bones of the fish. These bones were
called muYurJu (also the name of a renowned poisonous plant) and signified one side

of the clan's personality, its extremely poisonous (dangerous/ferocious) nature when
involved in warfare.17


              Concerning these uses of first the sculpture and then of the painting on the
hospitals, one of the other brothers observed that this was an explicit statement being
made by the Golumala clan of the significance of Warrukay in the area and of their

identification with and authority over the activities being undertaken in the hospitals.

In the newest hospital this is emphasised by the fact that the hospital is built on an

actual Warrukay site.

             As described earlier in Chapter 5 (B4) one man told me how Will

Walalipa had been sent with Harold Shepherdson to set up the mission at Elcho. He

had been sent by an old Gunbirrtji man on behalf of the Gunbirri 18 and Mfilarra clans

to care for their magayin (sacred elements) at Elcho. This was based on the shared

ownership of Warrukay.


             A different man told me of how Wili had arrived on the Island with

Harold Shepherdson, anchoring the boat on the Eastern coast, and of how they had

walked across the island and then down the western coast until they had reached

Dhugupu (First Creek), where they had met two old Gunbirrtji women and had made

the arrangements with them there about establishing the mission, When I was with

this man at Dhugupu he asked me if.I knew about Warrukay there. When I invited

him to tell me, he told me ofWarrukay's (Wili's) arrival at Elcho as if it was a story of

the arrival of a fish.

             Warrukay (barracouta) came from a long way away, Gurka I rjaga'yun
      [Will's Homeland Centre]. Warrukaycame up the creek. See how it's wide up

      he's up there now. That's the special place. They got rights if there's any meeting
      or any arguing or anything. My two miiri (Mother's mothers [from Gunbirrtji

not I didn't discover, however it was an analogical description of Wili's arrival and

permanent settlement at Gali win 'ku. The "myth", apparently only one generation old,
speaks of Will (as fish) coming from his homeland centre (which is a Warrukay site),
seen as his real place of origin, although he actually grew up on Milingimbi, and as a
man came from there. The comment on "feeling each other" refers to the discussion
based on mutual rights in Warrukay shared by the two clans and the feeling out of
Will's credentials. Also implied in the story is the idea that Wili as Barracouta, brought
with him his version of the sacred object and that it, together with the spirit being it
represents, is now established permanently at Elcho, thus giving Golumala
unchallengeable rights there. The reference to "that old story was there" poses some
difficulty. It may refer to the creek already being a Warrukay site, in which case the
story as it was told to me has the possibility of being an adaptation of an older myth.
Nevertheless, as it was told to me the reference to Will was explicit and that is the
point I wish to emphasise here.

              On one occasion Da,uataua, used the Warrukay transformation and the

relation between two different adjacent sites in the Galiwin'ku township to talk about
the generation of his own clan at Elcho.
            Gondarra dance barracouta, representing the Morning Star .garaka.(core)
            The burial place for my father (Will Walalipa) is ijalkanbuy, which is the
place where the fish lays her eggs. Gukuga reef is where the fish lives. The current
tank site had a sacred tree with the nest for Damala, which watched the fish as it
comes in to lay eggs (Djekurr) at the burial place.

              There are two sites involved, each representing a different Dhuwa clan,
!jalkanbuy, the present hospital site, where the barracouta is said to have laid its eggs,
and next to it, Damala Yalu (the Sea Eagle's Nest)19 where the town's high level
water tanks are now built Interpreted, this then says that the Golumala fish (which in
this context refers to Da,uataua,'s father)20 came ashore and laid eggs (established his
own family line). The eagle (other Dhuwa clan) watched this and approved.



19 Damala, the White-breasted Sea Eagle is listed by Clunies Ross (1988.37) as Damalkurra, and as
one of the Morning Star spirit beings.
20 Davata\)a's father and several related kin are buried in a family graveyard now established on the
site (see Chapter 5 for further discussion also plate 5.5 and Map 5.7).

             This apparently simple story of the eagle at its nest watching the fish
coming to its own adjacent nest21 is one example of a Yo]-Ou way of referring to the
establishment or maintenance of a relationship between clans. It brings us to another
aspect of Gapiny group perspectives of the Banumbirr complex; that of the
relationships between clans that are either established through it or affirmed through it.

       Relations between clans.

             Djiniyini Gondarra asserted that Golumala had a central role to play in
linking other clans because they are connected to the !}llTaka (the central wooden core)
of the Morning Star and other clans are the wana (lit. arms= tasseled strings) of the
Morning Star. He said that,
            There are several different strings which run out They represent different
      clan groups, Djapu, Murru:gun, l'jaymil, Djambarrpuy:gu Dhamarranydji and
      Djambarrpuy:gu Guyula and many others. Golumala and l'jaymil represent the
      !}Maka (bone/core).

            We are called Gondarra Yarrayamnirri because we identify with the raid
      and .garaka (the strings wrapped around the core) of the Morning Star. The
      surname Gondarra comes from that :garaka (core), and tells story about
      Warrukay. There are the names for that 11araka, Guyu!un, Marawirrku,
      Djunmildjunmil, Gupumbu, Gondarra, Guywuwu. It has those names because it
      represents fish. That (identification with the strings of the core) gives us a
      central role in linking the other clans together, as they all connect to the central
      strings (and so without us the connection would not be there for them). I don't
      worship it, but respect it because I gain something from it. Others respect it also.

              On a separate occasion he said,

             There are three names for the 1}aTaka (the wooden core or stem) of
      Banumbirr. Gondarra, Guywuwu, and Yarrayamnirri. These three are used for
      gunbur(evocations in the form of sacred names)22, so that we gunbur'yun (call
      out evocations) like this, "Gunbur ... ... Gondarra, Gunbur ......Guywuwu,
      Gunbur ...... Yarrayamnirri. For Golumala, the 11araka (core) comes from
      Gundalmirri which is close to Buckingham Bay. In the dreamtime at the start of
      its journey it also took special stone (ratjpa). Muthamirri Gunuwa:ga were the
      original people here, and then Guywuwu Gondarra, Yanma!a Dar'miny, and
      l'jaymil Yalwutj~u. Milinditj is another name for ratjpa (haematite ore). It also
      has two other names that you can't publish that are used for gunbur'.




21 "Nest" has also analogical references to grave, sacred site and homeland centre and see also
M«PhY (1984) who describes a funeral as a journey to the crocodile's nest.
22 Both moieties practice this calling out of sacred names for a variety of ritual purposes. Dhuwa
clans precede each evokation with the word gunbur' Yirritja clans use the word dalkarra.

              Here the centrality of the strings on the core of the Banumbirr pole (as
also described earlier by Wa.Qaymu in relation to his painting) are used as an argument
that runs as follows.
             The strings, with feathered tassels attached, which represent the other
       clans involved, are attached to the strings that bind the core of the pole, which
       represents the Gapiny group. [Though in this case, primarily Golumala and
       secondarily tjaymil]. The core strings support the other strings and form the
       foundation for them all, therefore it is the clans represented by the strings on the
       central core which have the most significant role in establishing relations
       between the other clans.

              Dji,niyini on an earlier occasion had suggested to me that this same
position on the core was one of the reasons why Golumala clan had such an important
role to play in the Christian church, because they played a central role in the
relationships between the clans. As well as carrying messages about Gapiny group
relationships, the complex carries cosmological analogues of the Yoliju
understandings about birth and death.

       Concerning Birth and Death.

              Inside the mouth of the Barracouta is what was described to me several
times as "a basket" (bathi or batji according to dialect) that was very important. Three
separate statements were made to me by different members of the clan.
             There are three names for the bathi where all the little fish go in. They are
Dhawuthawu, Gayimnaja and Yalakanydja. In the centre of the picture is a single
large painting of the actual fish, warrukay. Along the two sides of the painting are two
long thin warrukayrepresenting the Banumbirr with feathers. 23 MuYurJu, the bones
of the fish are painted scattered along these. When the large warrukay is used for
burying yo4Jul]IJ13ka (people's bones) it is called Larrayaya by Malarra and
Marawirrku by Golumala and tjaymil.
           The bathi inside warrukay, what do you call it ? Guts? sorts good food
from bad and vomits out the bad. That bathi is called dhawuthawu.

               There are two different sorts of :o8!111larra (conical mat). The names
Mumlt)u and Dhawuthawu come from the Warrukay gill covers. Call it batji (basket)
not .fJ1!111Jarra (conical mat). The barracouta has small strings on the outside of its gills
that hang from its throat. There is a bathi (basket) in its throat. Real ownership is
Golumala Gondarra and Yalwutjil)u tjaymil.



23 This was in reference to the painting from the hospital (Plate 7.4).


                                                    305

               This basket appears to be able to be perceived in different ways. One as

the guts or belly of the fish or the hollow space inside it and one as the removed head

of the fish which with its gill covers is slightly basket shaped. It appears though that

in general it is thought of as the hollow area inside the fish. An interesting

juxtaposition in the third statement links together the conical mat ({Jan_marra) and the

ceremonial basket in much the same way as they are linked in the DjaIJ'kawu story.


               The large Barracouta described earlier by W ajaymu in his bark painting,

is used as a coffin. Another man explicitly linked this use as coffin with the idea of it

being also a canoe (or boat) and a basket, when we were discussing different names

for coffins.

              Larratjitja is the boat name for Rewa [a leading Gunbirrtji man]. It is
  magayin (sacred object) of Gunbirrtji and is both Larratjitja and W arrukay.
              The outside term is wanukay for all Dhuwa, for three tribes, instead of
  saying "coffin". You can say "bathi" for everyone. Like, "Bathi (coffin) is coming
  tomorrow", or whenever. But the special name Larratjitja is for any Gunbirrtji
  person's coffm.
              The coffin is a picture (image/representation/transformation) of the
· Yirralka (homeland centre).
              Naku (canoe) is a term used for all coffins, but martha:gay (boat) is for
  Yirritjaonly."


               In this set of comments we find W arrukay linked to the place where the

little fish swim in, (a euphemism for spirit children entering the mother's womb) to a

basket (with similar meanings) and to the canoe (which is simultaneously a basket)

which transports the deceased to their homeland, while also being a transformation of

that homeland. Each of these is then, according to context able to function as an

analogue of the other with the implication that the little fish can also refer to the

deceased returning to their homeland.


               The choices made by each of the three leaders of the three Gapiny clans

 are reflected in the kinds of power held by their children within the Galiwin 'ku

community. Nevertheless the choices made by them and their children, and the

 advantages gained are all supported on the basis of mythology. The Morning Star

complex is used by all of them in a wide variety of ways to justify such things as

personal or clan status, power and relationships of all kinds including dominance or

interdependence. It is also used to verify identity. In such uses of the complex there is

also oportunity for expressing indirectly or directly a range of attitudes from

antagonism to disdain.


            Each of the clans gains some advantages from the corporate nature of the

group, particularly from the increase in support that this brings when in confrontation

with outsiders. However each is also in competition with the other for shared assets,

and each therefore very carefully emphasises its own priorities and its own

significance, using the Ba,numbirr complex to its advantage in this, not only within the

group but also in relationship to other clans to which they are connected.

   OUTWARD CONNECTIONS THROUGH BANUMBIRR.

            To this point of the discussion, the connections made between clans

through Ba,numbirr and its transfoniiations, have been considered from the

perspectives of various individuals from the Gapiny group of clans. I now examine

some of the outward connections which facilitate relationships with others of the

Yol:ou clans and beyond these to peoples outside the YoI:ou cultural and linguistic

block. I examine first some comments made by people from the Gfilpu and

Djambarrpuy:ou clans at Elcho, and by members of the Djapu and Rirratji:ou clans at

Yirrkala. Following this I give indications of ways of tracing the complex outward.

The section then finishes with some evidence of the further spread of the complex

both within and beyond the YoJ:ou block.


            Glllpu    Perspectives.

            There are two groups known as Gfilpu, who are distinguished from each

other on the basis that one group has its sacred objects linked to the sea or saltwater

and beaches, while the other group links its sacred items to the freshwater and inland

locations. According to a Ga.Ipu Mo!J.ukpuy (saltwater side) version of the story

Ba.numbirr was first made by Wuluwuma at :rjandjit)ura. A Ga.Ipu Raypinybuy

(freshwater side) man said however that,

            Banumbirr starts at Burralk:u and comes from there to Buku-Qal (a Galpu
      and Djapu site). From Buku-Qal it travels in two directions.
            It travels south to Garrawanbuy Island (DhuQi Djapu) and then to
      Win~ (M~un) where there is a pandanus tree where he landed. From
      there it travels further south towards Numbulwara.
            It travels northwest to Gundalmirr (:rjaymil), then west to Wakurra ~iya­
      dhalinymirr Djambarrpuygu) which is between Lake Evelia and the barge
      landing. From there it continues to Dhugupu on Elcho and from there it
      continues west.


             This version from the second Ga.Ipu group overlaps in its details with

some of the locations given in Wagaymu's story, but claims that the start for

Banumbirr's journey is from a site held jointly by both Djapu and Ga.Ipu clans (See

Map 7 .2). All the Galpu paintings of the story that I have seen have been done by a

mOllukpuy (saltwater clan) artist and have focussed on the yam transform of

Banumbirr and on the story ofWuluwuma the mokuy (dead one/spirit

being)belonging to Ga.Ipu. This being is portrayed as constantly hunting for yams and

is said to have dug out male yams first and then female ones. 24


              Three paintings by Mandjuwi were available to me for discussion with

Gilpu men. One of them (Plate 7 .6) a half-finished one at the time of photographing,

has been included because of the way in which it portrays Banumbirr as yam and

some of the spirit beings dancing around it in the transformation as butterflies. It is

also simultaneously a painting of the spirit beings dancing around the Morning Star

and even though not finished the basket in which the Morning Star is kept can be seen

in the lowest fork of the "strings".

              The second painting (Plate 7. 7) shows, at the bottom of the picture, two

transfonnations of the spirit being who made Banumbirr. Wuluwuma is shown on the

left and Yagurryagurr on the right. Above them two gukuk [doves] are directing them


24 In GIJpu ritual these are constructed differently, the male one with three strings and the female
with one.

"old people". Wwrkagi [an unidentified grub or perhaps maggot] lives in the ground
and eats and spoils ganguri. (yam). In the painting adjacent to wurrkagi are the
"holes" where wurrkaji goes in. The holes are also the place where items used in
cleaning wounds are put. Gululultja/wwrkagi comes to them.

             The third ofMandjuwi's paintings (Plate 7.8)25 shows two
transformations of the spirit being, Wuluwuma on the right and Yauurryauurr on the
left. In this the focus is entirely on the gathering of the yam gulaka/ganguri.. The
mokuys (dead ones/spirit beings) are assisted by the doves and watched by butterflies.

They carry the long digging sticks which are perceived to be transformations of both
the yam and the Banumbirrpole.

             Another Ga.Ipu man told me of a Morning Star pole that he had in his
home which was very precious to him for reasons he himself explained,

             I am Ga.Ipu. and we have Morning Star. It comes from Burralku, what we
      think is the place where all our dead dance there. Our Birrimbirr goes there
      when we are dead. When a man dies we cut off his beard and send to other
      group like Golumala, and they make Banumbirr and give to me or my sister and
      start crying cause that's my father. I can send it back to them to renew it. If I
      pass away they keep that and show the kids and so on. I think Burralku is
      something like heaven, but here on earth, an unseen place. Sometimes we call it
      an island. The bible talks about at the final judgement. Burralku, that's the place
      for waiting.

             In these comments he displays attempts to bring together the Christian and
                                          _j

Yo)Vu concepts of Heaven and Burralku respectively, and in his final sentence arrives
at what appears to be a completely new interpretation. It is interesting to see where the

focus of his discussion lies in his comments on family and his beliefs in an afterlife.
Any perceptions of mokuys (spirit beings) or of the travels of the Morning Star are
irrelevant. This was not so for the other Ga.Ipu speakers nor for the things that the two
senior Djambarrpu~u men had to say. For them, names, actions, and relationships
were the centres of interest.

             Djambanpunu ideas of the various types of Banumbirr.

Bini Gulipawuy explained, as he drew Figure 7.2, that there is a wide variety in form
of the Banumbirr constructed by different clans. He said that the Djambarrpu~u
Banumbirr starts on the salt side where the mokuy (spirit being/dead one) named
Bukugila or Y arrwani sings it at Gouuruy, although it earlier came from Gundalmirri
and Manamnanda to Gouuruy. From there it travels
             to the north of Gouuruy. At Munyana it goes high. At Gonyami is high,
      then show at Jjunuyuntjurr. Then it is pointing to Djarraya and then pointing to
      Galiwinku. [See Map 7.3]Then it becomes daylight and goes back to its same
      place at Buku-~a.
             Dha.odhav is the name for Djambarrpu~u Wutjara Banumbirr. It is a
      single star and also a string.
             Guyula I Liya-dhalinymirr Djambarrpu~u is different. It has three stars.
             Gilpu, Djapu, and Umbakumba and Rose River have long string and
      three stars. also a long pole. Murruuun is like that but separate.

ceremonial area; but outside, because it was not magayin (secret ceremonial)and the
women and children watch it.

             Djapu     Connections.

             The Art Gallery of New South Wales allowed me to use photographs of
two paintings made by Maw' in 1960 (See plates 7.9 and 7.10). I was able to discuss
these with Daymbalipu, who is senior son of the artist's oldest brother. The original
story supplied with the painting is as follows.
            The Morning Star Ceremony is associated with the dua moiety spirit
      island of the dead at Buralgo where two spirit women let out the Morning Star
      on strings.
            The dancers of the ceremony are shown in two lines on each side of the
      ceremonial ground, at the top of which is a representation of a high post to
      which three strings are attached, the dancers holding the free end. (At the end of
      the dance the strings are committed back into the sky to three positions
      commonly occupied by the Morning Star. The consent of two spirits depicted
      on their island above the dancers, is always necessary for the strings to reach the
      Morning Star). A yam, the food of the spirits, is shown horizontally at the top.
      On the right are two men on an island and Jawalngura in a canoe. Also shown
      are brolgas, water snakes and a dingo. The cross hatching represents dust from
      the dancing."

The paintings, identical except in their degree of abstractness, are masterpieces of the
encoded message in the same way as was able to be.shown with Wag;tymu'spainting
which was discussed earlier. Apart from the bracketed second and third sentences of
the second paragraph above, the story (not discussed) was confirmed by Daymbalipu.
These two sentences remain a mystery to me as they are not supported by anything I
have encountered concerning the Morning Star.

             As described by Daymbalipu, the painting depicts Djapu truth at a number
of levels. First there is the story of Yawuluura's journey to Burralku represented by

him in the canoe, by the two women (Gurmyinuu and Yambuyambu) he left behind

on Gayawukawurru Island and by the dancing of the Morning Star that he discovered
at Burralku, where they dance very hard day and night. At a second level of meaning,
the dancers are the Dhanbul people and the pole is called Dhambu127. The Dhanbul
people were the original inhabitants of the Yirrkala area and the painting is a depiction

of them dancing the ceremony both as real life people in the past and as dead people at


27 Note the slight change between the two names.

Burralku. Their leader was Manyguluma, Garratjuna, and Gog-bi!ma. At a different

level, the dancing shown represents the Djapu people dancing the ceremony. The

edges of the dancing ground that enclose the dancers have meaning as that which

encloses, so that when seen as the transform of the yam, yukuwa, growing in the earth

of the homeland centre the edges of the ground represent the homeland centre itself.

Yukuwa28 is human food and ceremonial object. In contrast to this the yam painted
across the upper section of the painting is buwaka or yukuga, and is food for the

mokuy(dead ones/ spirit beings).


             Rirratjil)u ideas about Banumbirr.


             The Rirratjiuu clan based at Yirrkala had a number of different things to

say about Banumbirr.

             "We," said Witiyana's father, as he drew a picture of his clan's Morning

Star, "make the uaraka (core) the same as ijaymil [clan]. In painting it is the same, but

the feathers are different"
            We use a wooden star instead of feathers. The patterns of four painted
      stripes around the pole are Rirratjiuu. The ordinary name for the pole is
      Guyulun, and Dhurupu is our special name. The star, the yothu, (child) is
      named Milwurrurru, Djambut, Banumbirr. (See Figure 7.3).


             He also made the following connections between Morning Star,

Djq'kawu, and a bible story,

            "In Rirratjiuu, Banumbirr more deeper is Djau'kawu. When on sea
      paddling, looking for land, saw the morning star rising up on sea and it break up
      the night - after that saw sunrise.
            Those wise men in the bible have same story - saw star guiding.
            Star tells about new creation before the daylight in both stories.
            Only the picture the same.
            The Djq'kawu are under Christ because didn't make anything bad."


             In this passage there is another example of the constant struggle the Yoluu

have as they seek continuously to find the relationships between any one thing and

everything else, and to see where the new can be related to the known. Here we see

yet another attempt to pull together Christian teaching and aspects of Yo)-Ou religion. If
Christ is Lord and all he does is good, then the Dj~'kawu who brought good

relationships and ceremonial must be related to him. (That is, they can't be evil).

              The Rirratjit)u use the yam called Mawuka (lpomea graminea) as a
transformation of Banumbirr. There was a painting of this yam in the craft room whilel
was at Yirrkala and I made a brief sketch of it (See Figure 7.4.) which I was later able to
discuss with the artist's 'sisters, Baluayuu and Mamburra (Banduk). Ba)-Oaygu said that,
               The strings on the Mawuka (wild potato) belong to each clan. Some clan
       may have long string some may have the short string." ("Maybe Rirratjit)u,
       Djapu and Marrakulu have long and I think the others have shorter strings").
       Some may have the short string off the Banumbirr. Mawuka is for painting- not
       make it It represents Banumbirr. The yam is only found on Bremer Is and a
       little jungle area at Yipilana. Rirratjiuu and the Djambanpuygu from Bremer Is
       sing the songs of Mawuka.
             These people as you see in the painting are making a potato. The other
       man is singing and the other man is playing a didgeridoo. They are making the
       potato with feathers and strings while other people are dancing. The food is
       mostly found at Dhambaliya (Bremer Is) which is not far from Yirrkala. The
       branches represent the homeland centres which are Dhuwa country only. "The
       clans are Rirratjit)u, Marrakulu, Djapu, Djambanpuygu, Dhugi Djapu, !:iya-
       gawumirr, Marrauu Da,!i.wuy, ijaymil. Nine altogether.

              Here Mawuka is spoken of as synonymous in meaning to Banumbirr. 29
BaJ.oaygu listed the names of nine different clans linked by the Morning Star as yams.
These however are not the only clans involved and from a variety of sources, it is
possible to trace Banumbirr to other Yoluu clans and beyond that to other peoples
who have relationships with the Yoiuu and I examine this wider distribution further.


              Clans Linked by Banumbirr.

              During my enquiry I have had Yoiuu supply me with ten different lists of
the clans who have Banumbirr, though on no occasion did I attempt to encourage


29 There is an apparent conflict between the two paragraphs as in the first she says it is not a made
object, just a painting, and in the second the painting is described as being of the yam being made.
This can be resolved if the English word "made" is a translation of the Yo)vu word "buma" which
can mean both "make" and "collect or gather". (It is apparently not collected as food). Another
equally possible explanation is that she was referring to the Rirratjiuu women's rights. That is, they
are allowed to paint the picture but not to make the object

them to list all the clans that were involved, but simply relied on the collection of
spontaneously listed clans. The longest of the lists included eleven clans and the
shortest, five, but when the lists are collated there are altogether twenty-three clan
groups named. Keen (1978:222) lists eight clans with the Morning Star and one of
these is not included in any of my own lists.

            Warner (1937/58.39-51) who made his observations between 1926 and
1929 recorded a list of twenty-two Dhuwa clans, of which fifteen are said to have
"Barnumbir" as a "garma totem". Later (p401) he speaks of one other not included in
his lists of clans making sixteen altogether. Of his sixteen, eight are not in my list,
which proves nothing more than that they were not included in any of the lists I
collected. Collation of the three sets of lists produces a total of thirty-two altogether
that are said to have Banumbirr. An additional aspect of particular interest is that one
of the most consistently named clans in my lists (seven out of ten) is not listed by
Warner as having Banumbirr. This is my Murru:gun (his Marungun) from south-west
Elcho Island. If this is a mistake of omission on his part, that is one thing, but if his

list was correct at the time, it means that at some time during the last sixty years they
have acquired it. This remains as a possibility, particularly when it is noted that in
several stories of the travels of Ba.numbirr towards the west, it is Murru:gun country
that is the last area visited by the star. Firstly Murru:gun on Elcho, and then Murru:gun
further west This would accord with William's (1986:38) comments concerning the

way in which extensions to the mythological paths are made.

            While considering Warner's list it is also worth noting that at the time he
made his notes he listed Gapiny (his Kapin) as a single group speaking ?jaymil (his

Mukkanaimulmi) or Galpu, which are both dha:gu languages the same as Golumala. It
is possible that here is a hint that the three currently separate clans that are part of
Gapiny may have only a short time (the same sixty years) during which they have laid
claim to separate identities.




                                                323

             My suggestion is that there is a good possibility even ifthe data is
tenuous, that at least some sections of the Banumbirr complex could be quite recent in
development in comparison to the normally perceived antiquity ofYolI]u mythology.
This idea is supported by the description quoted earlier, associated with the Warrukay
transform of the Morning Star, that implied that it was a myth which was only as old
as the mission (founded in 1942). In practice it is not the antiquity of any aspect of the
BB!!umbirr complex that is relevant to the Yol:gu, but its usefulness in terms of
communicating awareness of the inner reality and its effectiveness as a political tool.

             In Wajaymu's story and other narratives, the Morning Star was listed as

travelling west as far as the MurruIJun. Further to the west, and beyond the fringe of
the YolI]u linguistic group, Clunies Ross recorded the Morning Star amongst the
Anbarra who speak the "Gijingarli" dialects of the Burarra language, who live near the

mouth of the Blyth River. By the time the complex has been communicated this far
west "Guyulun" has become the common name and.Banumbirr (their Bornumbirr) is
an alternative name, and in this western area, the star is described as being definitely
female. The sugar glideris still associated with the star, though now named
"barranyji"30.The transformation of Warrukay is as mentioned earlier, now called
Larreija by the Burarra. It still maintains the same physical appearance in both
paintings and sculpted forms but is glossed in Wild (1986 Guyulun Bark No 1) as
sawfish and in Qunies Ross (1988.19) as "a large fish waIJarr from the open sea".

             In the same area the RembarrIJa artists, represented in the Australian

Museum in a collection from Maningrida, make both bark paintings and Morning Star
poles, though in this collection the poles are named Mularra.

             In Wagaymu's story it was also listed as travelling west as far as the

M~un.        Other evidence of an extension of the complex towards the south of YolI]u
country is only sketchy but nevertheless indicative of a spread to Numbulwar (Rose

sup glider.

River) and to Groote. An earlier quote from a Djambarrpu~u man listed the star as

travelling as far as Umbakumba (on Groote Eylandt) and Rose River to the south.

Waddy (1988:156) describes a link between Bickerton Is and Groote through dambul

(a Yirrkala name for the Morning Star pole) which was described to her as "a stick or

piece of wood to which feathered strings were attached" and likens it to the Maradjiri

pole described by Boorsboom (1978:167). Waddy (1989:102) also lists the name for

Venus (the Morning Star) as "Barnimbirra". Turner 1974 describes Dambul as a

hollow log coffin decorated with parrot feathers and string and made by the spirits of

the dead which was brought to Groote via Bickerton Island from Muru:gun country on

the mainland south of Blue Mud Bay. It would appear from just these brief references

that the Banumbirr complex has been used to establish relationships not only within

Yol:gu territory, but beyond it at least to the south-east, south and west.


            So it can be said that the Morning Star Complex has been used as a tool to

establish and maintain relationships throughout the whole Yol:gu block and beyond

that to non-Yol:gu neighbours in at least three directions. This is completely in keeping

with the Yol:gu attitude towards boundaries of any kind. That is they are found by

them to be an anathema. If these peoples outside the Yol:gu block speak different

languages and live in somewhat different ways, then it is important to find a way

through these obstructions. The Morning Star is just one way of achieving this.


            To this point, I have examined the ljaymil and Gapiny perspectives and

considered some of the connections to other clans, while simultaneously describing

some of the ways in which the complex is used and revealing some of the basic

analogical references contained in the complex and its transforms. The analysis of this

material will be considered in more depth in the final chapter. Some of the questions

which have not been examined are concerned with the mythological basis of the

complex. Is there one myth or are there many? If there is variation, of what kind is it

and what causes the variation. Some parts of these questions have been answered in




                                              325
                                         Chapter 7. Banumbirr : The Cosmos Portrayed.
general terms but I now consider them in relation to a number of versions of the myth
that are available and some of which have already been published.

   NARRATIVE              VERSIONS.

            Considered in summary, the complex as I have shown in the earlier part
of this chapter describes the star being made by a mo.kuy (spirit being). This star is
sent out each day before dawn and at daylight is hauled back on its string by a woman
who stores it away in her basket where it stays until its next journey. To this outline a
wide range of elements can be linked by the narrative, and as I have shown, any of

these can form the focus for a further set of linked ideas. In this way the outline of the
complex can be expanded by a wide variety of supplementary details according to the
contextual needs of the situation. For example, the star in its journey can be explained
as stopping at, or visiting certain sites that are linked to named Dhuwa moiety clans.
This then is given as the explanation as to why these clans nowadays make the
ceremonial object, and are related together through it.

            The earliest published version of the story comes from Warner (1937 I 58
: 524 - 528) who gives a comprehensive version of the Banumbirr (Morning Star)
myth which I have summarised in Appendix G.

            Warner gives no indication as to whether this narrative came from a single
speaker, though it appears to be a compilation from various speakers. On the basis of
tbc wide variety of stories that I have heard, overheard and recorded over a long
period of time, it appears to me that the normal approach to story telling is to take a

potential core for a story and arrange around it any of a wide range of details. If one

listens to a story about a single subject from two different narrators, each can tell the
story in such a way that any or sometimes even most of the details that appeared to be
the core when it was told by one, are omitted by the other. Warner's story appears too
comprehensive and to have too many foci to have come from a single speaker on a
single occasion, and he gives a hint of this in the first paragraph of the story where he



                                              326
                                             Chapter 7. Banumbirr : The Cosmos Portrayed.

notes a difference in details supplied by different narrators. 31 His version forms a

useful baseline for comparison with subsequent versions that have been recorded by
myself and others. I have divided it, for the sake of comparison with other versions,
into six episodes.

             The first part of Warner's story which recounts the journey to and from
Burralku corresponds to a story told to me (mostly in English) by Mathaman Marika
at Yirrkala in 1967, and jotted down as he told it with only two brief references to
Banumbirr. I include the complete story in Appendix B for comparison with the
above.

             As can be seen from a comparison of his story with the one recorded by
Warner, there is little mention of the Morning Star in Mathaman's version. He focuses
his story on the journey of Yawuluura to Burralku and back, with its verification of
the existence of the place of the dead. So the Morning Star itself, focus of other
versions, is almost irrelevant here except for the one brief mention. The details of
sections 3 and 4 of Warner's narrative which deal with the star's guardian and the
star's journey are completely omitted.

              Thornell (1986.62-64) tells a version he recorded, apparently also at
Yirrkala between 1938 and 1944, which is very similar to the one told by Mathaman.
It too omits sections 3 and 4 of Warner's account. In Thornell's version it is a branch
of a tree that brings the message to Yawuluura [his Yaulngoro]. As in Mathaman's

version,
            he leaves his wives at Djurrwanbuy Island [his Jirrwanboi], travels for
      days following the rising of the Morning Star, knowing that this will lead him to
      Burralku [his Baralgor], comes to an island where he digs for turtle eggs, is
      surprised by an evil spirit, and leaves hurriedly to continue his journey to
      Burralku.




31 One other aspect of YoilJu story telling is that from version to version details may change
without there being what can be considered as the correct version. The correct version is always the
one being narrated at the time of narration. Whether Warner's version is a compilation or not, the
details he recorded would have been correct when they were told.


                                                    327
                                              Chapter 7. Banumbirr : The Cosmos Portrayed.
              Some of the details of the actions at Burralku differ. In Thornell 's account
(as in Wamer's) Yawuq,ura is given a positive welcome by the people there, met by
"the great Bapa" (biipa =father) who tells him he was sent for "so that you might

return and tell your people of this place" and then returns home.

              In Mathaman's story there are details of the things he sees and the dances

he performs, but he is met by Mfilumbu and Yambuyambu and definitely not
welcomed. Only in Mathaman's version are there specific details of food taken for the
return journey. In both Mathaman 's and Thornell 's he reaches the island and collects
his wives, in both he tells his story and in both he dies shortly after. In Thornell's
story there is the extra detail that one of his wives has given birth on his return.
Thornell records that his death is due to illness, Mathaman that it is from sickness due
to over-eating turtle eggs.

              When these two versions are compared with the corresponding sections of
Warner's record there appears to be disagreement about the clan to which Yawu}Uura
is said to belong, Warner says he is Gfilpu while Mathaman says he is l'iaymil. These
are closely allied clans, and as both speak the dhaJJumirri language it is possible that in
some circumstances both could be referred to as Gfilpu. Warner mentions the outer
island, but no leaving of wives there on the way, while the other two narratives record
the same name for the island and leaving of the wives. Warner notes that there is

variation between informants concerning the length of the journey and this is
exemplified in the three narratives, with each placing different emphases in different
places.


              It becomes obvious that there is a dearth of any sexual comment in the two
journey narratives, while these are explicit in Warner. 32 Warner also records that
Yawulijura brought with him from Burralku a Barrumbirr "emblem which was made


32 I would suggest that the probable reason for the difference here lies in the fact that at the time of
recooling both Thornell and I were missionaries and prior to the seventies sexual aspects of life were
considered as not normally appropriate to discuss with mission staff, but suitable for discussion with
non-mis&onaries.

of seagull feathers and the yam" (both of which were apparently separate made
objects, though the record does not specify this) and there is no mention of anything
like these in the other two narratives.

            The section of Warner's story, which concerns the Morning Star's
journey, is related to the story told on tape by Wa.Qaymu of the rjaymil clan and
recorded at the beginning of this chapter. He was one of the men referred to by

Mathaman as belonging to the same clan as YawuhJura. The story he tells gives some
details of the myth and although the narrative is told as the outward journey of the
star, the focus is on Banumbirr as a ceremonial object, and with relationships between
clans and land.

            When Wa.Qaymu's story is compared with Warner's version there is
agreement between the two in that in both Ba,numbirr is a made object which travels
from East to West, visiting the territories of certain clans. Beyond this however the

comparison fails. There is a major difference in focus in the two. In Warner's version
the actions of the figure Yawuluura are the centre of interest. In Wagaymu's story
there is an explicitly stated focus on the rjaymil clan homeland centre where we have

Baftumbirr being made by Yawuiuura. This is then used as a base for the activities of
Baftumbirr as a Wavarr (spirit being). It is described as having a wooden :garaka
(core) with arms of tasselled strings. After being made powerful Banumbirr has a life
of its own, and throughout the narrative can be interpreted as a spiritual entity which

by itsjourney and actions is establishing relationships between clans.

            This notion of the place of Ba,numbirr in the relations between clans is the
focus of a further recorded discussion which I had with Galpagalpa of the
Djambarrpuy:uu clan. He, like Wagaymu, described Banumbirr as being made at
Gundalmirri, but he gives the being a different name, saying both, that this being made
it at Gundalmirri, and that Yawuluura made it at Burralku. This can be interpreted in
two ways; that Gundalmirri and Burralku are two names for the same place, or that the
one spirit changes its name according to location. Like Wagaymu's story, the contents

of this discussion refers to the origins, ownership and journey of Banumbirr. It also
reflects the political aspirations and relationships of the narrator.33


              In Galpagalpa's version of the story (Appendix H), he focused it to

emphasise the Golumala clan's claim for significance. He states that Will, the then
senior member of that clan is boss for Banumbirr. On this basis of Golumala rights he

is then able to claim rights himself through his mother's mother's brother. The last
paragraph, a sort of addendum to the story, emphasises first the relationship between
the ceremonial complex and the star in the sky, then goes on to question the reality of
Burralku. 34

              There were other men from different clans whose comments on their
clan's versions of the Morning Star myth produced some details which matched well
with details of the above narratives and some that were quite different. One of these, a
Galpu version, is included. I have recorded it as a variant narrative although it was
really a discussion of some of the details of Galpu paintings of the story (See Plates
· 7.7 and 7.8.). It is included to give an indication of the range of variations. The
problem raised by the ambiguity in Galpagalpa:? comments is partly answered here by
                                                        ,-Y<i,


some of the statements made about Banumbirr by Yalkarriwuy. Though I recorded no
further full versions of the myth, the importance of the other variations needs to be

carefully considered. Yalkaniwuy said that Banumbirr was made first by Wuluwuma
and that the whole object also is ganguri. (a yam) and its gurrkurr(strings/sinews)
were the yam creeper.

              In his Galpu version, the Banumbirr is reported as being originally made

by a Galpu clan mokuy (spirit being/dead person) at a Galpu site. However there are
two subdivisions of the clan relating to separate geographic territories and with the

much as is needed for a coherent set of infonnation for discussion
34 1bis same type of suggestion about the veracity of Bunalku has been made to me by a number
of seoicx' men over the years. There appears to always be a degree of scepticism about the facts
proposed by others. so whether their questioning is a result of their commitment to Christ, or
whelher the existence of Bunalku has always been questioned, can only be guessed at. There is no
way now of ever knowing, as all but one of these old men have now died.

best recording that I could do I was not able to consistently distinguish whether he
was speaking of one mokuy or two. It appears as if he explicitly states that these are
two names for one being, the separate names being names given by the two Gfilpu
groups, with the names being related to the mokuy at their own site. In the painting
however, they are represented as separate individuals, drawn differently and
recognised as discrete. On a different occasion the same informant said that
Bll!!umbirr was made at Burralku alias Dhunumbiyala by a mokuy for whom he gave
five names, none of which matched either of the above, but some of which matched
names given by other YolJJu. (See Table 8.4).

             Yalkarriwuy's comments show a completely different emphasis from all
the previous narratives, because his focus appeared to be on the spirit being and on
Bll!!umbirr's association with a particular yam. In this he commented on the nature of
the being, its actions and behaviour patterns, and various aspects which form the
particularly Gfilpu section of the coQ.lplex. Each of the species names are also names
of dances and songs which are danced and sung by Gfilpu clan members at times of
ceremony, such as funeral wakes.35 In his description some effort has been made to
communicate sets of alternative names for different elements of the story. Again,
names are demonstrated as having importance in terms of their ownership and in
tenns of their capacity to focus the associated network in the interests of the clans

owning the particular sets of names.

             In the variations found between the six versions discussed here, there is

clear evidence of the ways in which stories in general differ in their narration
according to context, and of the purpose of such variations. There is quite obviously
no such thing as one correct version. Each clan, and in fact each individual, has a
separate agenda which is among other things, always related to rights and their
maintenance. Each of the narratives discussed, apart from Warner's version, places



35 Al such times they dance the various actions of their spirit being, such as digging yams and
slapping mosquitoes.

particular emphasis on the speaker's own interests. Where other groups are mentioned,
the priorities of one's own group in relation to the others appear to be inevitably
attended to as part of the focus of the narration. As far as the Banumbirr complex is
concerned, the narration of the story is manipulated on every opportunity to the
speaker's own advantage, while giving the impression that the focus of attention is on
the star.

   CONCLUSION.

             In this chapter I have now established some of the basic details of the

Morning Star Complex. There are three stars in the sky, each of which is named
Banumbirr. I was not able to identify the first two of these although the third one,
variously referred to as the real or main Banumbirr is the planet Venus. It is this that
comes up from the inside in the east, and it appears to be true to say that this forms the
basis upon which the whole complex has been developed through a process of
analogical transformation. The five basic facts which were outlined in the introduction
as forming the core of the complex can now be seen to be used differently by different
clans. The location in which the original Morning Star is claimed to have been made
has been shown to be clan specific, and relative to whichever clan a particular
Banumbirr belongs. The generalised site, Burralku (which appears to refer to spiritual
rather than physical origin) may be named as the place of origin, or the Morning Star
may be spoken of as beginning at the specific clan's homeland centre. 36

             On the basis of these variations and other supportive data, it is possible to

deduce that there is not simply one Morning Star being spoken of, but a number. Each
of these refers to a constructed ritual object which appears to have been used as a tool
for the establishment of relationships between clans. It is possible to explain the
outworkings of the long "journeys" described as being made by the star with two
variations of a single theme.

36 This latter was shown to be the case for Gal.po and Djapu, :rjaymil (with Qa!iwuy and Golumala)
and DjambarrpuYlJU clans, each of which was able to claim their own site as the source for the
consuuction of Banumbirr.

            When a ceremonial gift is given it is a part of a whole ritual, including
songs and dances, and accompanied by the whole. The ceremony is received by those
who are to receive the object. Sometimes such a given object is wrapped and stored as
a whole item. This is apparently quite common treatment nowadays with the
establishment of permanent dwellings where they can be stored. (Inside and out of the
reach of small children). Alternatively, as the identity of such an object is "in" the
strings with which it is decorated; these may be unwound off the core, the core buried
or otherwise disposed of and the strings stored. As shown in Chapter 3 there is an
analogue in this of the disposal of the dead. This is between the persons v;uaka
(bones) and the object's v;uaka (core) and between the ongoing existence of the
identity of both. When required again for ceremonial, such stored strings used to
construct an object, would in fact construct one with the same identity.

            My best understanding of the journey then is the giving of an object
(original or reconstructed) in a chain of successive ceremonies from one group (and
hence one site) to the next. A ijaymil Banumbirr or a Djapu or Galpu or any other
named Banumbirr would then be identified with the group by which it was originally
constructed and given. The fact that there are a wide variety of differently constructed
Banumbirr would support this.

            Linked to Banumbirr I have shown also some of the transformations of it
which are either used as support for, or alternative statements about the established
relations by different clans in different ways. I have also argued that the ownership of
these various elements and transformations within the complex are manipulated in a
variety of ways. These include using them as tools to think with, instruments to teach
with, and as support for argument in the struggle for political advantage over other
groups.

            In the final chapter of the thesis which now follows, I complete as far as
possible the analysis of the complex. I attempt to analyse in more depth some of the

established from the material available.

            CONCLUSION.

            In pursuing the analysis of Yo4Ju cosmology I have shown, in line with the

general definition discussed in Chapter 1 of this thesis, that the Yo4Ju cosmos is an
ordered whole with its own unique framework of concepts and relations, a framework
which brings descriptive order to the whole and to man's place in it. The analysis has been
applied to a series of major conceptual areas, the structure of each of which has been
shown to be related to presuppositions made by the Yo4Ju particularly in relation to
change.

            It remains now to draw together these separate analyses to demonstrate how
each separately forms a model of the overall cosmos and how each separate model forms
a part of the whole. In the sections which follow I first examine how the presupposition
of changelessness has influenced the notions of time and identity, and in conclusion
discuss the models of the cosmos which are carried by the Banumbirr Complex and by
Yo~ relationships with    both man and with space before drawing together the composite
model which they present.

            TIMELESSNESS               AND          CHANGELESSNESS.

            I have shown that the continuum of time and the measurement of time while
of great importance in Western thought are largely irrelevant to the Yol:gu, and that this
very irrelevancy is of major significance in understanding Yo4Ju cosmology. Absolute
time in Newtonian terms is apparently not considered, each event being located according
to its co-occurrence with or its relationship to known events of three kinds. These are, the

recurring events of the earth itself, the physically and socially marked events of the
passage through the human life and those events which can be described as revelations of
the "inside" reality. The recurring events of the earth include the fixed events of sun,
moon, stars, winds, rains, heat, cold and plant and animal growth patterns.




                                              335
                                                                   Chapter 8: Conclusion.
             Some of these were shown to be named in series. For example sections of the
day or seasons of the year, each of which is a qualitatively identified event or time
location to which any other significant event can be related. The human events were
shown to include both those of the normal physiological stages and also those that are
sociologically constructed and celebrated in ritual of one kind or another. However it has
also been shown that while noteworthy events can be located in relation to human life
stages or in relation to earth events, it is more important to locate them in relation to
geographic space.

             There is a problem, for the analysis of the Yoluu approach to time, which is
generated by the juxtaposition of the presupposition of changelessness with the facility to
locate events in relation to the human life stages or the recurring events of the earth. This
problem arises largely from the fact that the relation of events in terms of human life
stages and earth events appears to be structured in fundamentally the same way as the
Western approach to time measurement and therefore such location of events is seen by
the Western observer in terms of time.

             In contrast to this, such location of events by the Yoiuu is, while a location of

them in relation to reality, a location of them in relation to a largely atemporal cosmos. In
doing this, the location of events in terms of geographic space is what is important, and
this can be in relation to either or both the inside or outside aspects of the cosmos.

Because reality is considered by the Yoluu in terms of location in space, it is the
geographic space aspect and not the time aspect which is the focus of attention, the
location of events associated with both the inside and the outside of reality being related to
this.

             As I have demonstrated in Chapter 6 the continuum of time is of no relevance
beyond the present cyclical or human event and one adjacent category of event, and this is
the limit of precision possible. It is in this level of the location of events that they are
usually seen in relationship with the outside aspect of reality. What is significant here is
the relationship between the events and not the time but the space of occurrence. Beyond


                                                336
                                                                       Chapter 8: Conclusion.
the relationship between the events and not the time but the space of occurrence. Beyond
this limited range in distance, a shift occurs and any events of importance are seen in
relation to space and their significance is seen in terms of the inner reality. In this way all
events of significance are transformed by their nature into an atemporal state.

            Such events as are recorded, recognised or celebrated then become a record of
human relationships and usually human relationships at the level of the "inside" reality
though the outside aspects are not discounted. Such relationship events as are
remembered and passed on, then become a record of relations with the inside aspect of
reality, losing any temporal and eventually even sequential reference more and more as
they become distant from the present.

            In this way, historical events such as the visits of the Indonesian trepang
fishermen from Makassar, or even the more recent movement of the Golumala clan to
Galiwin'ku township become associated with events described as being baman' (at the
beginning, far distant) and eventually become incorporated with what white people have
called "The Dreamtime", the "inside" reality, losing all temporal reference except far
distance and gaining present location in the inside reality. The presupposition of
changelessness is then not in conflict with time conceptualisation.

            I have shown that a relationship exists between cosmological existential
presuppositions and perceptions of (or interpretations ot) the cosmos in which it appears
that the presuppositions determine the perceptions of the cosmos and the subsequent
conceptualisation of it. As a result of this it appears that there is strong support for an
argument that suggests that the various social, religious and cosmological structures used
by the Yo]-Ou are presuppositionally determined. This would then support Mary Douglas'
claim, quoted earlier that each cosmology or world view is a theory which "has its hidden
implications" (1973:173). This being so it should be possible now to give some
indications of the effect of presupposition on the perception of the cosmos and of the
perception of identity within that cosmos.
                                                                        Chapter 8: Conclusion.
            In Chapter l, I cited a statement made by Rrurrambu in response to my

enquiry as to the roost valuable thing to Yol:ou people. He said that this was knowing his
identity, where he fitted and who and what he was. I argued there that for Yol:ou people
identity was defined in terms of relationships and that this included relationships between
families and clans but also kinship relationships with places, natural species, some other
things and sacred items of a wide range. Not only are human identities defined in this
way, but also the identities of all the things to which humans are related.

            YoI:ou identity as I have shown is defined in terms of the individual's
perceived relationships to other people (including groups), to place, to the magayin
(sacred emblems of all kinds) and to the other living elements of cosmos although the
particular use of any of these four categories is relative to the context in which a definition
is being made and any of them may be the most significant (at a particular time)
depending on context.

            Humans appear to have identities at a number of different levels. Each person
has a discrete identity as a human individual while some aspects of that identity are
concerned with the identity of the clan of which that person is a part The whole clan has a
single identity so all parts of the clan share that same identity though the most senior men
(and occasionally women) represent the most complete manifestation of the clan's

identity. One consequence of this is that when there is conflict between clans it does not
matter which member of the clan is retaliated against as each is equally a manifestation of

the clan. Similarly each lineage has a corporate identity of which each individual is,
potentially at least, equally a part. Again, the children of one woman, who have the same
father, share a common identity which is a composite of aspects inherited through both
the matriline and the patriline.


            If as Jordan (1974:275) says the identity of an individual can be defined as

the "location of the self in a particular world of meaning, both by self and others ...a

product of interactions between individuals and social structures and individuals and



                                              338
                                                                             Chapter 8: Conclusion.
others", and if identity is a social construct (eg Berger & Luclcmann 1966: 194) and
"individuals construct their identity by locating themselves within a particular model"
(world of meaning) (Jordan 1988: 109), then security of identity is dependent on the

security of the model or models of the cosmos maintained by the group and the
individual. According to Christie ( 1988:3) it is of prime importance for Yo~u people to
be involved corporately in "discovering together and living out their Aboriginal identity".
There is then a constant corporate and individual interaction between a group's

cosmology, their identity as a group and their identity as individuals within the group.

             In the case of the Yo~u with their presupposition of changelessness this

interaction is able to be interpreted as an ongoing process of discovery and revelation of
the identity which is. Thus hypothetically this means that all relations including power

relations are eternally fixed and those who hold power do so by right of a sort of eternal
decree thatsays, "This is the way it is". In practice however this is not the only approach
that arises out of the notion of changelessnessl and it can equally be asserted that if an

individual or group is able to gain an advantage over another, (by fair means or foul), that
that gaining of advantage must have been part of the eternal reality of changeless identity
or it could not have happened. Thus the presupposition of changelessness is able to be
used to justify and explain both the control of power relations and their reversal; the
position of disadvantage and the gaining of advantage. If taken to their logical extension
this includes the continuous political manoevering for the gaining of control over sacred
items, land, and the reproductive potential of women and hence the increase in power of
vmiolls groups over others and all able to be justified in that it is the working out of an
eternally established state of changelessness. It is as Bos has suggested that that which is
now must always have been true otherwise what is now could not have come to be as it
is.




1 Stnter (1963: 168) makes an almost identical observation concerning the Murinbata.


                                                 339
                                                                 Chapter 8: Conclusion.
            Throughout the preceding chapters one Yo4Ju presupposition has been
emphasised more than all others; that is that there is no change. This is spoken out by
Yoq,u in many different forms and presented in many ways. I have repeatedly had older
men say that the rom (law, lore, way, system, ultimate truth) does not change like white
man's laws but always stays the same. Then in the extended conversation with Rrurrambu
he emphasised, using the metamorphosis of the butterfly as an example, that no matter
what outward shape he may have appeared in to his father, he had not changed but simply
gone through a transformation. This presupposition was shown to apply particularly to
the notion of human identity as being unchanging.

            Particular results can be seen in the perceptions of the passage through life. If
the identity is without change then what is always was and always will be. In human
terms, if then a person always was and always will be, that person has to have existed
somewhere before conception and has to exist somewhere after death. Therefore,
presuppositions of a location for humans who are non-visible are a predictable
consequence. These in the YolIJu case have led to a further basic presupposition of the
cosmos as having two aspects; a visible, tangible existence which is outside, where all
observable phenomena are experienced, and an inside, invisible, intangible existence
which is nonnally not able to be experienced, but which under special or abnormal
circumstances may be experienced or which may be experienced by special or not
ordinary individuals (for example marrvgitjmirri [those with familiar spirits]). I have

shown how these concepts of "outside" and "inside" existences or or sides of reality are
quite broad concepts which are interpreted in a variety of ways with their meanings to a
large degree dependent on their context or the way in which they are focused.

            When Yo4Ju observe the changes which happen to an individual through a
lifetime, the presupposition of changelessness causes these to be interpreted not as
changes, but as developmental transformations which reveal further aspects of the already
fixed and unchanging identity. The implications of this are that all living things including




                                             340
                                                                     Chapter 8: Conclusion.
humans are seen to go through a series of transformations, each of which is a more
developed expression of the identity than the previous one. Consequently when this is
combined with observations of the passage through life, the inevitable conclusions drawn
are that this is a one way passage with normal human life as the particular event during
which the full expression of identity becomes manifest just prior to or at death. Death then
becomes an entry into the fulfillment of an eternal identity. There appears to be no room
here for the development of notions of re-incarnation.

            Another consequence for cosmological understandings based on the
changelessness of identity is associated with the place of an individual human in relation
to all other humans. A child is born into a fixed place in the network of relationships
which is established by the kinship network. As a result the individual's relationship to
the entire cosmos is fixed at birth. There is then absolute security for all conforming
members of society in knowing who they are. The gradual revelation of the full extent of
that identity is made clear to each individual in an ongoing ritual context, and for the men,
in periodic contact with the "inside" aspects of that identity in the men's "inside"
ceremonial ground with its ongoing revelation of further degrees of "insideness".

            A combination of the presupposition of changelessness with the notion of
transformation leads to the idea that one identity can have more than one manifestation;
potentially an unlimited variety of manifestations. As each manifestation is (not has) the
same identity as every other manifestation, an identity can potentially be expressed in a
number of different forms simultaneously. Similarly with the presupposition that parts of
an object have the same identity as the object, whether that object be a stone, plant, animal,
human or implement, any part has the same identity as any other part. This then is at least
a partial answer to the problem of "participation'' which bothered Uvy-Bruhl for the
entire course of his writing.

            What I have described as analogues throughout the thesis can from this

appears possible to say this even when speaking of a ceremonial complex as an analogue

of the cosmos, or a ritual object as an analogue of a man. It is for this reason that I have
not described them as symbols, for the notion of symbol implies one entity represented by

another. As transformations one of the other this understanding is a natural outworking of

the presupposition of changelessness.

            It is then in the understandings of the nature of identity that this
presupposition appears to have its greatest affect. By asserting the transformation of
unchanging identities of all kinds in contrast to a perception of identities in change and
then working this through in the various models of the cosmos that are used, change and
time are able to be made irrelevant. The results of this in terms of models of the cosmos

remains now as the final investigation of this thesis.

            MODELS OF THE COSMOS.

            Banumbirr as cosmos model

            The documentation that has been presented, in the previous chapter
demonstrates that B&!!umbirr is not a single precisely defined identity, but rather a
complex system of interrelated ideas and practices identified with, and having the name
of, the Morning Star. The complex includes myths of origins, song poems and ritual
forms and objects each of which can be seen both as a representation of, and as a
transformation of, the star. In all of these there are implied cosmological presuppositions,
and like all Y o~u activities, each presentation in any of the varied forms has political

implications.

            There are conflicting views concerning the sacredness or insideness of
different aspects of the complex that appear to be relevant to different contexts. However
the sacred aspect according to the prevailing climate of my investigation was obvious only

in regard to the actual ceremonial objects, and to certain names that are owned and
restricted in their use. As far as meanings were concerned, there appeared to be no clear
discrimination made between inside and outside meanings and there appears to be no clear


                                              342

boundary between inside and outside. Thus it is possible to say that there are aspects that

are clearly "outside" and others that are clearly "inside" and an area between the two

which at all time remains open to interpretation. 2


              In contrast to these views was the attitude of the young Gfilpu clansman who

spoke of his having a Banumbirr in his possession which had been made using his own

deceased father's hair. This was too important for public display and there was the same

reticence towards its being photographed as there is shown towards photographing some

of the very sacred objects from the secret ceremonies. Keen (in a personal

communication) notes a very similar attitude applied to a similar pole made at Milingimbi

and incorporating the hair of a deceased clansman. This particular attribute of sacredness

may well be linked to the Banumbirr's association with the particular deceased clansmen,

as the corpse of a deceased person is considered to be a sacred object. By incorporating

some part of the deceased in the construction of the object, this sacredness would

automatically be incorporated in the object as well.


              My intention in examining the Banumbirr complex has been to examine

enough of it to give some idea of its complexity, and to probe as deeply as possible the

,meanings and understandings of the cosmos that are incorporated in it. I expand the

analysis here, of the material presented in the previous chapter, to demonstrate the ways in

which this complex functions as a map of the cosmos. I show how it presents a series of

facets of the Yo]-Ou understanding of the Cosmos, and in doing so, functions as an

analogue of the Cosmos. I have at no stage attempted to cover all the aspects of the

Banumbirr complex. Any list of the associated song subjects would make it obvious that I

have covered neither songs nor their subjects and I have no intention of pursuing them

here. There is a great deal of potential for research in any of these complexes and it was

beyond the limits of my own work to attempt to be more comprehensive.




2 For example, two of the senior Djam_barrpu~uu men, Bani Gulipawuy and Bapawun quoted in earlier
chapters explicitly stated that Banumbirr was outsidepuy" (belonging to the outside) and so not sacred.

          Elements of the Complex

             Analysis of the data presented to this point reveals that there are a number of

recurring elements across the different versions of the complex, and that some of these

recurrences present a different name for the same functioning element. In addition it is

 overtly stated that certain elements of the complex are considered to be the same as, or in

 an analogical relationship to, certain other elements.


              The following elements appear to be basic to the complex; a. the tasselled

 pole, b. the basket, c. a male spirit figure frequently named Yawul:gura, d. a female spirit

 figure generally named Malumbu, e. Burralku as a location which is both source and

 destination of the star, f. the journey of the star, g. the star and h. the attached string.

 Supplementary to these are elements which function as transformations of the tasselled

 pole. These are, i. the yam plant, and j. the barracoota. Each element has its separate

 interpretations or sets of interpretations and meanings The interpretations and significance

· of these analogical relationships will be examined in more detail as the analysis proceeds.


              Each of the elements of the complex is seen as having potentially at least the

 interpretations shown in Tables 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3. While the listed elements appear to be

 basic to the complex in North East Arnhem Land, particularly as displayed in association

 with myth and painting, and these are the ones for which I was given interpretations, they

 are not all the elements involved. In addition to them a number of others have been

referred to in passing. These include; ratjpa (haematite ore), gugurrku (brolga), bonba

 (butterfly), birrkpirrk (masked plover), gukuk (bar-shouldered dove), milkmilk

 (mosquito), wurrkaQi (an unidentified grub or maggot), wiinq] (sugar glider), damala

 (eagle), djinydjapana (dolphin), gun_ga (pandanus tree), banumal/ganinyigj/dhurrtjithurrtji

 (a digging stick), djarrak (black-capped tern), gagayka (stringybark tree).

            Each of these elements appears to have its own significance, although not all
are relevant to all the clans that have Banumbirr. Each nevertheless functions as a
subsidiary link between the clans which share it as a common elements, and it appears
that, depending on the context, each is potentially a focus for the establishment of, or
maintenanceofrelationships.

         Clan Perspectives on Banumbirr.

            Each piece of separate data from a clan or individual is a statement from that
clan's or speaker's perspective, and each statement about Banumbirr reflects something of


                                         346
                                                                      Chapter 8: Conclusion.
the individual's use of Banumbirr as a political tool. A ijaymil speaker uses it to
emphasise through the story's narration, the veracity of his claims to ownership rights in
the parts of Galiwinku where there are haematite deposits. So he uses the Banumbirr
story to focus a complex network of related details on his own and his clan's identity as
custodians, users, and rights bearers in the sites he names. As he is currently the most
senior member of the clan, and hence the most complete expression of its identity, the
entire cosmos is centred on the importance of his identity of a single individual. He brings
about this focussing by pulling the strands of the network in such a way that the ones that
support his statements are emphasised, and the ones that support other clan's claims are
de-emphasised and made to appear less supported than his own.

            Golumala clan members and a Djambarrpu}'l)u descendent from a Golumala
woman placed high emphasis on the fact that their clan is represented by the strings in the
central position that are wound around the core of the Banumbirr pole. Based on this they
present the separate attachment of strings representing other clans to the central strings on
the core as an analogue of their position in the organisation of relations between clans. In
this way they attempt to focus an almost identical set of facts in their own direction, thus
emphasising the importance of their own position as a clan. They also link the central
position of the strings on the pole as representing their clan, with the notion of the pole as
being a transformation of Warrukay (barracouta). To this they also link the existence, in
the Haematite section oftheGaliwin'ku town area, of an important Warrukay
(barracouta) site as evidence of their affiliation rights in the site. They have emphasised
this relationship between their clan and this site by establishing a small burial ground on
the site in which deceased members of their clan, and some from politically important
supportive clans have been buried. ijaymil clan (mentioned above) who also "have"
strings on the pole itself, and also "have" Warrukay (barracouta) both as a transformation
of the pole and as a large hollow log coffin made similar claims by naming their clan as
having that central position on the core and adding Golumala claims in a de-emphasised
way. In this way each clan attempts to draw the focus of agreement and the centrality of


                                          347
                                                                       Chapter 8: Conclusion.
position to their own clan's case, while implying but carefully not ever stating that the
other clan's claim was of less veracity than their own.

            There is a further way in which prestige and priority appear to be developed
through the Banumbirr complex, and this appears to be related to position in the sequence
of the movement across Arnhem Land. Wagaymu's claim for the :rjaymil Banumbirr as
starting at the :rjaymil site at Gundalmirri is used by him as part of his claim for the
significance of his group. That is, it is as if he was saying, "This was a :rjaymil mokuy
that made the star and sent it on its travels. See how important we are that this important
Wau81T can have started with us. We have power here. We are people of power." He is in
this, working hard to establish the importance of his clan in relation to others, using its
origin in his country as a basis for his propositions.

            Gfilpu and Djapu men raised the same argument as a basis for their own
importance, but laid claims for the original construction of Banumbirr to have been at a
site jointly owned by these two clans. While there was agreement between the two in
terms of the place of origin, each of these clans has their own names for the mokuy
making the original Banumbirr and when they talk about it they do so using their own
names for different aspects of the complex. In this way they are emphasising their own
rights and their own significance as a clan.

            It is of interest that members of one of the largest groups, the Djambarrpu}1)u,
saw little need to emphasise their own importance in this complex and in fact, while
telling the story of a Banumbirr made by a Djambarrpu}1)u mo.kuy(dead one/spirit being)
in their own country at Gouuruy one of the senior men remarked that it had really come
there from the :rjaymil site at Gundalmirri. In some ways, this de-emphasising of
Banumbirr' s significance is a deprecation of the claims of clans whose claims for
importance are based on its use.

          Banumbirr as a complex of Entities relating to the Inside
                                       of Reality.

             Within the B8!!umbirr complex there are different kinds of inter-related
spiritual entities which are not always clearly distinguished from one another. The more I
attempted to analyse the information given to me about these different kinds of entities,
the more complicated the situation appeared to become to the point where it became
(outside of context) almost impossible to determine absolute categories of anything. It is
possible to arrive at some general definitions but never to be certain that the parameters of
such a definition include all that could or should be included and exclude all that should
be excluded.

             It is possible to speak of mokuy (dead ones/spirit beings) and wavarr (spirit
beings) and djamarrkuJj' (lit. children/ or a sort of nebulous, partly defined kind of spirit)
and I have attempted to give some outline of these concepts in Chapter 2. However when
. any precision of boundary is attempted for these definitions, they will not work, so that all
descriptions of such entities revolve back to being clear only in context, and not always
then.

             A lot is said about the mokuy(s) (dead ones/spirit beings) associated with the
Morning Star, and the term mokuy itself has been shown to be both singular and plural
simultaneously. When a mokuy is being referred to it can be difficult to discern whether
what is being referred to is a single entity with multiple names, or one of a series of
named entities. For example, in Galpagalpa's nmative he refers to two different names for
the mokuy who makes the Morning Star, Yawul~ura and Guluthumbirr, but distinguishes
 them as different by saying that Ya~ura makes it at Burralku and Guluthumbirr who
makes it at Gundalmirri. It is not clear however whether these are two names for one
 mokuywith one name specific to each location, or whether there are two discrete
individuals involved. To complicate this further is the difficulty of knowing whether
 Burralku is an analogue which refers to each homeland centre or not Galpagalpa gives

                                           349
                                                                        Chapter 8: Conclusion.

some indication that Burralku is not thought of as a real place which could mean in terms
of outside reality.

             Sometimes, what appear to be personal names for discrete beings are treated
as general classificatory terms. For example, Gou-bilma (lit.hand clapstick =Always
Singing) appears to be a euphemism for "songman" and used as both a personal name
and as a sort of general term. At other times a whole series of names appear to be given to

the same individual or class of individuals by YolIJu from different clans, with each clan
having its own names for some, and sharing other names with other clans.

             Table 8.4, gives some indication of the complexity of this naming process.
The list itself is not useful as a basis for forming theories about the names as it is simply a
collation of the names given in my presence by members of the named clans. The two
spellings of Dhanbul and Dhanbul are retained as I recorded them as they could be dialect
differences. I have earlier discussed the two names used by the two Galpu groups and
again it is difficult to be certain whether these refer to two discrete individuals or whether
they are separate clan names for one.

             The use of the wide variety of different names for mokuy (spirit beings) in the
different versions of this complex also raises the question of exactly what it is that the
various names are referring to. For example, when the different uses of the name
Yawull)ura are considered, the question that arises is whether this is the name of a man or
a spirit being. It appears that in at least some contexts he was an ordinary YolIJu man.
There are two activities of his that are described as the actions of an ordinary man. The

first of these is in the journey he makes by canoe to investigate a yam leaf brought by the
wind from the east. The second is his action in making the Morning Star dancing pole at

Gundalmirri. The first speaks of him unambiguously as a human male who visits
Burralku, the place of the dead, returns to his family, then dies and becomes a mokuy
(dead one I spirit being).

             In the second reference, made during the narration of the story of the

construction of the Morning Star pole, he can be interpreted as either man or spirit. There
is also ambiguity in the use of the word mokuy (dead one I spirit being). This leaves any
interpretation open as to whether the description is of a man who has since died, and who

thus from the present perspective is a deceased human and hence a mokuy, or whether

what is being described is the action of an independent spirit being, also called mokuy.

Such spirit beings are usually described as carrying out human activities, although often

in an exaggerated way.


            In addition to the complexities in identifying what is referred to as a mokuy in

different contexts, there is the possibility of a different set of multiple meanings linked to

them. This appears as a possibility when the different versions of the manufacture of, and

journey of Banumbirr are compared.


            The series of different descriptions and maps tend to indicate that there are a

number of different Banumbirr ritual objects being described, in conjunction with a series

of exchanges between groups. If this is correct and I have collected descriptions which

emphasise this as being so, it would appear reasonable to suggest that in some cases at

least these multiple names for mokuys could be the names of different human individuals

who were responsible for the construction of the different ceremonial objects. As they are

all now deceased, they are all now mokuys (dead ones I spirit beings) even assuming that

they were originally all normal Yoluu men.


            Mokuys are not the only spiritual entities involved in the complex. At one
level Banumbirr is the name of the Morning Star in the pre-dawn sky. At other levels it

can be the general name for the complex, or the ritual pole and the string. However in

WaQa.ymu's story the Banumbirr is spoken of as being changed by Yawuluura's actions.

By painting, decorating, singing and dancing, this mokuyfigure "makes it powerful", and

in paragraph four of his story Banumbirr is named as being a      wavarr spirit being. At this
level of interpretation we are confronted with a perceived transformation of the outer,

physical Banumbirr so that it becomes the embodiment of a spiritual entity of the same

name. Keen (1978:230) also records this discrimination between such wavarr Beings and

their, "everyday equivalent such as Red Goshawk Being and the red goshawk".

                  In this way the one name is used for different transformations of the one
     thing, so it can be difficult to know which form is being referred to. In contrast to this
     there are times when each of several transformation of a single entity has a whole series
     of names and this may include a number of sets of names with each set being used by one
     or more clans but not by all clans. Any one of the different elements of the Banumbirr
     complex can thus have multiple names or multiple sets of names, all referring to the same
     entity or to some aspect of the entity. Without the references being given with the names,
     that which is referred to is able to be kept secret3

                   In some contexts the star itself and its transformation as the feathered tassel
     on a string are referred to as a child and as such also as a discrete spiritual entity. It was
     described earlier as also repre~nting a transformation of the yam flower and as an
     individual clan member. This child entity, 4 here appears to represent a sort of pre-
     emergent or undefined human spirit that has not yet developed or assumed the complexity
     of spiritual entities which is the adult human.

                   "Man" is the last spiritual entity I wish to consider here, in this multiplicity of
     spiritual entities concerned with the Banumbirr complex. Man, and here I am referring

I!   exclusively to the male of the species, is a unique complex of spiritual or "inside" entities.
     This was exemplified particularly clearly in the two stories of Will's arrival at Elcho
I
     Island. One described him as a man coming with the first missionary, while the other
     described him as Wanukay (the barracouta) coming from his homeland centre at
     Ijaga'yun. One story spoke of him as a man, while the other spoke ofhim in terms of part
     of his spiritual identity as Barracoota. This is however only one part of his spiritual
     identity. He is also Yam, not just as an analogue, but as a part of his being, He is also




     3 As Keen indicates, (1978:179) when such elements are danced (or sung) reference is being made not just
     to the species or items, but to the wavmrbeings of the same name and diSposition. Thus in tile Banumbrrr
     complex, the Morning Star is associated with a whole "PB!ltheon of Wauar!" spirit beings, (to use Keen's
     ~hraSing) each of which functions to form different sets of links between distinet groups of Dhuwa clans.

     Morning Star Pole, and Genitor for his descendents, so each of his children is a
     replication of his own spiritual identity. It has been suggested to me in passing by some
     observers that the Yo~u believe in re-incarnation , a suggestion that the Yo~u explicitly
     deny, and this appears to be a misunderstanding of the nature of the multiple wavarrthat
     make up a person's spiritual identity and the handing on of names. In the same way as
      warrukay is the name for one barracouta fish, it is also the name of the identity

     "barracouta" which is both singular and plural. The children of a man carry on his identity
     of barracouta, not replicate the identical spirit fish which was him. The passing on of
     names is frequently from one living person to another and sometimes there are as many as
     three or four people with the same name living at the same time. Again this is not an

 I   indication of re-incarnation but of shared aspects of identity and in a Yo~u sense of being
)I
     part of each other.

 I                In pulling together this apparent confusion of possible interpretations I now

     propose an approach which appears to allow all the different accounts to stand as they are
     . while bringing a further level of understanding. That is, that all the different accounts are
     based on a mythologised religious history. With this as a basis for explanation, the
     different mokuycan be considered as being the men who made the different ritual objects
     in the different locations, but who, being now dead, are mokuy. Within only a short
     period of time, (perhaps as little as a single generation) it is possible for them to shift from
     one side of the domain of meaning of mokuy (as dead one) to the other side of the domain
     of meaning of mokuy (as spirit being). The different wooden poles are all representations
     of the same star and of the same spiritual entity, all of which have the one name
     "Banumbirr". Each different clan has a set of spiritual entities. These overlap with the sets
     that other clans have, but each maintains its own identity by retaining its own unique
     combination of entities in the form of wavarrspirit beings. In this unique set is the make-
     up of the unique identity of individual clans and their adult members, and it appears that
     the security of the clan's identity is dependant on the control of this uniqueness. If the set
     of spiritual entities is able to be matched by any other clan then their uniqueness of

identity would not only be seriously threatened, but completely lost. So Banumbirr is not

just a network in terms of the links between different w;qJarr beings, and between

different clans, but a network of interlinked networks associated with the separate sets of

links between clans, established not through affiliations based on natural objects, but on

shared relations established through the various w;qJarr beings.


           Messages of the Complex - Analogues of the Cosmos.

              As the Yol:ou person in possession of the full range of possible

interpretations, (if such a person exists), considers the meanings of Banumbirr, he is able

to see within the complex a considerable range of information about the nature of being,

including the nature of the cosmos. I do not consider that the interpretations of the

elements of the complex shown in Tables 1.1 tol.3 are in any way exhaustive although I

have attempted to be as comprehensive as possible. One of the aspects of such a complex

as Banumbirr is that because of the structures of analogical comparison, it is always

possible for the complex to expand, if by no other means, then at least by using analogue

as a tool to meditate with.5


              Using the interpretations listed earlier in this chapter, combined with the data

in this and the preceding chapter, it is possible to analyse a series of messages concerning

reality as being communicated by Banumbirr through the medium of analogy though

acknowledging that the communication of specific meanings is likely to be entirely

relative to the context of, and particular aspect of, the complex under consideration. I

consider a number of messages one at a time.




5 As discussed earlier, for the Yoluu this would not be considered as making new additi~~: but as
recognising a truth that had always been there. The reason for this lies in the structure of aruuogical thinking,
whicll is also both_ the process and the tool used by the Yoluu for the incorporation of chang_e. Because any
analogue is considered to be the same as, or qualitatively equivalent to any other analogue of the same thing,
any afialo~e is able to be considered as being ~ually as true as any other. Therefore, as I have emphasiscil
earlier, if It is new, it will be considered as having always been true, and as being simply new to the
observer. In essence it can then be thought of as a new revelation of eternal trudi, or of the inner reality. (
Bos 1988:392)

          Entry into the inside.

             Starting with Wagaymu's bark painting of Ba,numbirr as a ceremonial object,
and his narration of its journey, we find that Ba,numbirr was made in Burralku which is
an analogue of and hence equivalent to the :rjaymil clan's,homeland centre. Because the
pole with its feathered strings attached can represent the clan itself with its founder and
the attached strings re~sent the clan members as they come out from him it speaks of the
clan's origins as coming from the clan's homeland centre. During ceremonies the pole is at
times planted in the earth. It is then connected to the earth in the same way as the yam
transformation of the pole is related to the earth. That is, opening it, penetrating it, and
being inside it.With the pole or yam functioning as a representation of the penis, the earth
being penetrated by Ba,numbirr then forms an analogue of copulation. This same analogue
was implicit in the narrative as the male spirit makes Ba,numbirr powerful by singing and
dancing with it, while the female spirit cries for it and has her sleep spoiled by it. Implicit
also in this analogue is a further meaning concerning the relationship between the clan's
sacred I'a{}ga (ritual elements) which are kept inside the water at the clan's homeland centre
(one penetrating the other) and the relationship between the maintenance and care of this
relationship and the growth and strength of the clan. The clan's sacredness, identity and
actual members, past and future are inside at that site.

          The Afterlife.

             Entry into the afterlife is also analogous to entry into the "inside", and to re-
uniting with the waoair beings that are associated with the homeland centre. This uniting
with the waoairis graphically illustrated in the construction of the Gfilpu Ba,numbirr
described in the introduction to this chapter in which a deceased man's hair is incorporated
as part of its construction so that the man, represented by part of his body, and the
Morning Star waoarr (Spirit Being) become a single unit. To plunge the pole into the
earth then becomes an analogue of the man's entry into his homeland centre and hence

into the afterlife.

                                                                       Chapter 8: Conclusion.


             If the various analyses of the analogues are applied to the bark painting by

Maw' (Plate 7.9.) there are immediately a number of interpretations of the painting made

available by the analysis, which reveal by analogue a number of perceptions of the

painting.

             a. The figures in the painting are men dancing on the ceremonial ground.
             b. The figures are mokuys dancing at Burralku.
             c. This is the yam penetrating the ground at the homeland centre.
             d. This is the Yam Being (and simultaneously a member of the clan) going
                "inside" at the homeland centre, and being celebrated by the mokuys there.
             e. This is an analogue of copulation.
             f. Therefore the dancing ground is a reproduction of female reproductive
                organs.


             Because the act of copulation is an entry into the "ultimate of sweetness" in

the woman's body, then death can be considered to be movement to a place which can be

described as the place of ultimate sweetness. This place, described as B urralku, is an

analogue of the homeland, the place where the clan's yam grows and where the rauga

(ritual objects) are kept in the earth.


             The entry into the inside which here means into the afterlife, can be interpreted

as analogous to the pleasures of copulation. As a result, as a man approaches his own

death in his old age, through his meditation he is able to see this as a positive step to the

place where the B~umbirr myth describes endless dancing (a euphemism for copulation)

and the enjoyment of good food in abundance (eating being another euphemism for

copulating).


         The Passage Through Life

             When the men are dancing with the pole and tuck the pole into their crutch as

they dance with it, the pole was explicitly stated to be representing an erect penis. The

action simultaneously represents Mfilumbu pulling the string attached to the star back into

her basket, which is the inside of her reproductive system. This dramatised analogue


                                          357
                                                                 Chapter 8: Conclusion.
gains more power when Mlilumbu is recognised as an analogue of the earth (or a

particular site) as mother from which the child spirit (represented by the feathered tassel)
comes looking for its human mother. 6


             Because the star can be considered as a transformation of the identity of any

clan member the act of Mlilumbu letting out the string attached to the star from her basket

and then pulling it back into it speaks of the clan member's movement through life as
being a journey in which he or she comes eventually from Burralku (alias the clan's

homeland) and returns again there at the end of the journey7. It therefore also speaks of

the journey and the passage through life as being out from and back to the clan's

homelandcentre.


          The Place and Nature of Man.

             Throughout the Banumbirr complex, man is shown as the genitor in whom

exists the full identity of the clan and who is responsible for the continuance of the clan

and of the spiritual identity of the clan. Portrayed in the mokuy creator of Banumbirr he is
shown as the one who manufactures the pole and makes it powerful. This is the pole that

carries the Morning Star (child) to the various homelands centres. Here is a fairly explicit

picture of a man's erect penis bringing children to his women, and man is quite clearly

portrayed here as a physical being. Man is also as the pole and its various transformations

a spiritual being whose identity is a composite of the various wagarr spirits represented

by the transformations.


          The Place and Nature of Woman.

             Woman is represented in the complex as the place in which the clan develops.

She is the clan mother and portrayed more in this role than in her role as a sexual being




6 One woman said to me that her father had actually told her that when he dreamed of her conception, he
dreamed of her as the Morning Star coming to her mother.
1 As was more fully explored in Chapter 3.


                                                  358
                                                                      Chapter 8: Conclusion.
though the latter aspect is much appreciated. Her reproductive function is to receive the
child from the man. This function is portrayed in various ways, as the woman who stores
the star in her basket before letting it out, as the basket inside the barracouta into which
the little fish (children) swim, and in a painting by Wunuwun (in Caruana 1989:95), as
fish swimming into a fish trap.

            While the man's responsibility is seen in terms of the genitor, it is the woman,
as daughter of the clan, who is responsible (as I showed in Chapter 4) for passing on the
clan identity through the matriline, and it is the women who will carry the spiritual identity
of the clan inside them for three generations before it comes outside again.

            The role of woman is portrayed in each of these ways in the complex
although the focus of the complex appears to be not on woman at all. Her function is
given the appearance of being peripheral to it. To draw out more from the complex than
this could lead to the error of imputing more than the complex actually communicates.

         The Nature of Existence I Identity.

            Banumbirr has been shown to have a range of transformations which is
potentially unbounded. As a statement this implies certain things about the nature of
existence. Whether an identity is an object like Banumbirr, or the identity of an individual
person, it is considered to be an unchanging permanent identity that always was and
always will be. Change is seen to be not in the identity, but in the potentially unlimited or
even continuous transformations in the expression of that identity.

         The Banumbirr Complex as a Model of the Cosmos.

            The Banumbirr complex can be regarded as one model among many models
of the Yo~u Cosmos. Whether a single aspect of the complex is considered in isolation,
or the complex is considered as a whole, there is a statement being made that, "This is the
way it is." The various forms of the complex are in this way direct expressions of the



                                          359
                                                                      Chapter 8: Conclusion.
cosmological presuppositions of the YohJu. These assumptions will be considered in a
later section of this chapter. Here I wish to examine the outline of the cosmos that is
portrayed by Banumbirr, to consider the "This" of the above statement, the perceived
reality.

            As I mentioned in the first chapter of this thesis, one man, in attempting to
sum up the nature of a cosmos in which all things are understood to be in relationship
with all other things, said to me," You should use the word 'network' ". As I continued
the research I began to realise how apt and carefully thought out was his choice of the
English word. There are aspects of a net which enable it to act as a suitable analogue of
the cosmos in that a net can be considered as a series of points connected by strings.

            In some ways similar to a net the Yol:gu cosmos viewed from the perspective

of a single moiety is formed of a network of points linked together in all directions, and
the Yol:gu not only speak of ceremonial connections between clans as strings joining
them, they use actual decorated strings to demonstrate these connections. This also is
quite clearly demonstrated in the Banumbirr complex where the strings wound around the
core and the strings connecting the feathered tassels to it are used as visual statements of
those relationships. Again, the string on the star let out from Burralku speaks of
connections between the "inside" and the "outside", of the living and the dead, it links
clans and clan sites on its journey. Here however, the "net" analogue breaks down and
"network" becomes more appropriate as there is no simple quantitative equality in the
pattern of interconnected points in the cosmos which would compare to the mechanical
arrangement of spacing in a net

            The Yol:gu in attempting to explain the patterns of connections and
relationships which make up their cosmos, frequently resort to the analogical use of the
structure of plants, not quite in the same way as these are used in the Western
construction of "tree diagrams", but in three other ways. The first of these is similar to the
use made of the yam plant as seen earlier (Figures 4.15, and4.16), which has something


                                          360
                                                                       Chapter 8: Conclusion.
like a single origin from which comes a series of successive branchings, though in some
the paintings, notably that by Wagaymu (Plate 7.1) the yam is shown with multiple roots.
A second structure drawn from plants is based simultaneously on two separate aspects of
a tree's structure. There is the overall pattern of the tree's growth with its branching roots,
a single trunk and then the branches above, then there is the notion of the layering of outer
bark, inner bark and still further inside, the wooden core. The one further way in which I
have had them used to ~emonstrate relationships was a drawing made by D3.1Jat3.1Ja
(Figure 4.17) in which he drew a series of yams side by side with each representing a
separate clan, and then interwove their branches so that these formed a similar sort of
network to that formed by the overlapping branches of trees in a forest. This was drawn
to demonstrate the ways in which the clans associated with Banumbirr are interlinked
through a series of marriages over a period of time.

            Within these three structural analogues there are several important notions
which relate to the Yo4)u perceptions of the nature of the Cosmos. First there is as I have
mentioned, the notion of connections between points which are described by the Yo4)u as
"relationships". Then there is the notion of "focus". In the tree there is the trunk to which
all roots and branches are connected, and in the yam structures, there is a focus in the !uku
(root or foundation). Imposed upon this notion of focus, is the critically important notion
of "identity", for identity, which is seen as unchanging, is also seen as the sum of all of its
expressions and connections.

            The Banumbirr complex exemplifies these notions. The name Banumbirr can
be thought of as a nucleus, or as a focus. When considered as a focus it can be a point to
which all the associated points connect; when thought of as a nucleus, it can be a point
from which all the attributes radiate outward towards other points. In Yo4)u practice, both
approaches are seen simultaneously. For example the identity of "Banumbirr" is seen to
be star, plus ceremonial object, plus yam, plus clan, so that when any one of these is
under consideration, it will be the focus, while all the other analogues remain equally part



                                           361
                                                                      Chapter 8: Conclusion.
of that identity but unfocussed. Each of these transformations connects to Banumbirr and
each of them in tum forms the focus of a further network of ideas concerning the nature
of the cosmos. While the other aspects are not at the time in focus, they are nevertheless
under consideration as part of the whole identity.

            Within the complex we find various sets of inter-connected points. There is a
set of clans linked by their common sharing of rights in some aspect of Banumbirr and
these clans are in tum connected to a parallel set of sites similarly seen to be
interconnected through their relationship to the travels of Banumbirr.

            At an entirely different level of connections I have shown that Banumbirr
itself acts as one focal point with connections of different kinds reaching into many
different aspects of the YollJu world. There are links to the fields of poetry, music and
painting, links to and statements about the nature of sexual relations, procreation, and the
roles of the sexes. There are links to other ceremonial complexes associated with such
other points as particular spirit beings, various yams, and the barracoota, and each of
these other elements can and do form further connections outwards to other aspects of the
YollJu world. This interconnecting continues until the whole cosmos is formed into a
single interwoven whole built out of an apparently endless series of overlapping networks
of relationships.

            The structure of the cosmos, according to this analysis can be summarised as
an unbounded multi-dimensional network of interlinked points. Within this cosmos, the
points are held in focus, and their identity defined only by relationships to the network of
supporting points. Thus Banumbirr as a model of the cosmos and as an identity, is
supported by multiple levels of surrounding points, each of which reinforces the
statements it makes about the nature of "The way it is".

      Human Relations as Cosmos Model.

            As mentioned in the discussions of the Morning Star, and earlier of kinship,
the Yol:gu use plant structure as an analogue of human relations. It has also been shown
that such analogues are many-layered and that the plants as analogues of the structure of
relationships, are simultaneously analogues of the Cosmos itself, each analogue
reinforcing the other.

            Human relations discussed in Chapter 3 in their transformations across time,
and in Chapter 4 in their perceived atemporal state as fixed relations between individuals
and between groups also function as a model of the Cosmos; as different ways of making
the statement that says, "This is the way it is. Everything is fixed permanent and
unchanging".

            The individual is born into a fixed relationship with every member of his
family and of his clan and through this system of kinship terms is related to all other
individuals, clans and by extension, peoples on the earth. He is aware of this from early
childhood, each relationship being discovered, named and learned and every new
individual fitted into the pattern as he grows.

            As a model of the cosmos the synchronic relations between individuals and
clans form analogues of the relations between all things in the cosmos. Each individual is
connected by specified relationships to every other individual and these relationships
whether traceable or attributed are patterned on those seen as established between the
closest of kin. Similarly relationships between clans, established through the ravga
(sacred objects) and the matriline are seen as fixed in such a way that any new
relationships established must be new expressions of what has already existed either
"inside" or somewhere else. These relations between humans and groups are then
extended to the whole cosmos so that all relevant elements are able to be considered as
being in a permanent relationship to all other elements.


                                          363
                                                                      Chapter 8: Conclusion.

            By extension all things and all people on the "outside" are in relation to all
things and people that are "inside" so we have a cosmos which is in one sense divided
into an outside and an inside network and in a second sense, a single all encompassing
network of related elements with two expressions.

            This brings us to an aspect of the of the relationship system which I have
discussed throughout the thesis but not drawn attention to prior to this. That is that the
kinship system itself is not just a single network, but is structured in a way that is
analogous to the relation between "outside" and "inside" reality. That is, while it is a
single entity it is also a dual entity. There are two moieties, each with its own mythology,
each with its own sacred objects, each ensuring that its sacred identity is passed on
through the matrilineal transfer of daughters and each using the other as the mother for its
children, with the children of the females of the clan (the waku) functioning as the
guardians of its sacredness. Thus the relationship between the two moieties forms yet one
more analogue of the relationship between "inside" and "outside". The males of each
moiety use the females of the other moiety to ensure the reproduction of their own clan
and moiety in a way that is analogous to the "outside" elements of the cosmos entering the
"inside" elements (man entering the inside at death) and vice versa (children entering the
outside at conception).

            The model of the Cosmos presented by the pattern of human relations then
depicts the elements of the Cosmos as being in fixed relationship where there is no
change. However by interpreting these relations as being in a fixed and stable state in the
"inside", the outer manifestations of them are able to be adjusted, in accordance with any
newly revealed "truths" about the inner reality, or in line with political expediencies. Thus
change can be incorporated into the network of relationships at any level of description of
them while maintaining that there is no change in the "inside" reality of the cosmos.

      Relations with Land as Cosmos Model.

            Many of the relationships between humans and human groups have exact
parallels in the relationships between human groups and land. A child pre-exists at a place
which is significant to the father's clan and is directed to the mother who nurtures the
maturing child in her womb. She however is part of her own clan's land and because of
this her land is then seen as being in relation of mother to the child and hence to the child's
land. In this the woman's womb, with the child within, is an analogue of her husband's
sacred site within which are kept the sacred objects which are analogues of the clan and of
its pre-conception individuals. These "sacred objects" or pre-conception individuals
become transformed to become first children and then adult members of a clan that is of
the opposite moiety to the woman, the woman's clan and the woman's clan's site. Thus a
site of one moiety carries inside it and functions to bring into the outside reality, the
sacredness of a clan of the opposite moiety.

            This intellectually ought to present a major philosophical problem, as the
ancestral beings portrayed in myth as linking sites, and depositing the sacred elements of
each clan's identity never cross land of the opposite moiety. This dilemma appears to be
solved in two ways. Firstly in the role of waku who is both woman's child and also
mother's mother's mother's mother. Waku is both human and land; sites being in relation
to each other in the same way as the humans born from them. Thus by having an
inheritance between sites matrilineally for four generations, the sacredness of one moiety
is carried inside the other and moiety sacredness manifests itself in alternative matrilineal
generations. So the cosmos that is Dhuwa is inside the cosmos which is Yirritja and
forms an exact parallel of the understanding of the relationship between "inside" (where
things are not manifest) and "outside" (where they are manifest) and the relationship
between matrilineally related sites becomes one more analogue of the relationship between
the two dimensions of existence.




                                           365
                                                                                  Chapter 8: Conclusion.


              Pursuing this further, waku (both sexes having the same sacred identity) is

the one who cares for the mother's clan's sacredness and the mother's land's sacredness,

so the waku site and clan of one moiety is in this relationship of caretaker and of authority

over the sacredness of the mother's clan and land that are of the opposite moiety. The

strength of this caretakerrolewas demonstrated particularly with regard to the Galiwin'ku

town site where the son of the last female of the local Gunbirrtji clan was seen as having

authority over that clan's sacred objects and land even though it is of the opposite moiety.


              The dilemma of the notion of a site of one moiety functioning as the bearer of

the sacredness of the other within itself is also met through one of the very things that

appear to emphasise the dilemma. That is that the ancestral beings mentioned above as

linking sites, and depositing the sacred elements of each clan's identity are said to never

cross land of the opposite moiety. Frequently in myth, the way this is described is that the

ancestral being either "goes up" at one sites of that moiety or "goes inside" at that site and

then "comes out" at the next site of its own moiety, so that within the myth itself is

frequently carried the notion of being "inside" while traversing the territory of the

opposite moiety.


              The relationship of caring exemplified in waku (sister's child/woman's child)

is also reflected at cosmological level where men are seen as having a great responsibility

to care for things that are of the "inside" whether those things are the sacred objects or the

deceased person at a funeral. In both these situations again, the waku has a primary

function.


              This relationship of caring appears to be taken for granted as a two-way thing.

That which is of the inside is also seen as caring for that which is of the outside. While I

collected no overt statements of this type of caring (by that which is inside) it does appear




8There is reasonable evidence in the Yolgu tteabnent of celestial constellations to suggest that these could be
considered as "inside" so that inside is potentially located above as well as below.


                                                 366
                                                                       Chapter 8: Conclusion.

to be implied in some of the versions of the journey of the man, YawullJura, to Burralku

and back, particularly in the welcome given to him by those who were there, and

provision of women and food for him. It can also be suggested here that when waku is

caring for his mother clan and its sacredness, it is the inside aspect of that clan carried

within waku which is doing the caring for its outside manifestation. Since Christianity has

been espoused, caring is also one of the most commonly focussed-on attributes of God.

He is prayed to as the personal djiikamirri (the one who has care of) and responded to as

one who blesses and brings peace and happiness.


            In all this the cosmos is seen as being permanently established with

everything in a fixed relationship to everything else. At all levels of duality, outside and

inside, Yirritja and Dhuwa, there is not just a fixed relationship, but a fixed relationship

where each is not only inside the other, but each has a responsibility to care for the other.


            Within the "outside" cosmos sites are identified by a number of aspects.

These include their physical attributes, but are generally more to do with the association

between the site and those manifestations of the "inside" reality which are related to that

place. It is the combination of these manifestations which forms the focus of the identity

of any site; the network of relationships between a site and other sites on the bases of

kinship and shared mythological entities, is what completes that identity. Because of this

way of constructing identity the identity of a site is unbounded in the sense that it is

always potentially open for expansion on the basis of further revelation.


            This combination of the focussing and networking of relations as a basis for

identity is then analogous to the cosmological identification of human beings except in the

one detail that humans gain their identity not from relationship with just a single site but

from relationships with a networked set of sites and associated ritual elements, the unique

combination of which forms the basis for human identity. Thus deprived of land the

YollJu is deprived of a large portion of the basis of his identity and without affiliation

with land is unable to adequately define that identity.

            The model of the cosmos presented by or contained within the relationships
between humans and sites and between sites is of a two-sided reality each side of which
is composed of an identifiable network or network of networks with each of the two sides
being contained within the other.

CONCLUSION. THE MODELLED COSMOS.

            I have now presented several different ways in which the cosmos is modelled.
That is, through the Morning Star complex, through human relationships and through
relations between humans and sites and between sites. These can be reduced to two
models simply by recognising that relationships between human, humans and sites and
between sites are all analogues one of the other so that they form a single model. When
this is compared with the Morning Star complex, these are, as would be expected,
complementary to each other, producing between them what appears to be an effective
cosmologicalmodel.

            The cosmos according to this model is composed of a potentially unlimited
range of elements, each of which has its own discrete identity. Some of these (the
presently relevant ones) are recognised and known but there is always the possibility that
others will become relevant. All elements are linked together in networks of relationships
which in tum form the basis of identity and as a corollary of this, without relationships
there is no identity. It is this that is the basis on which the establishment of relationships
becomes an imperative.

            The cosmos itself has both an inside and an outside aspect, and each element
of the cosmos has, potentially at least, an inside aspect which is unchanging and an
outside aspect which goes through a series of transformations. It would appear from the
ideal of the models presented that the inside is where all things exist in unchanging
relationships but that there is a kind of maturing or perfecting process undergone by all
living things. This process involves a transformation from inside to outside in an


                                           368
                                                                       Chapter 8: Conclusion.
 immature state, progress through a series of transformational stages (apparently always
 thn:e or multiples of three where thes stages are specifically identified) whereby
 maturity/perfection is reached prior to a final transformation into a state of perfection back

 into the inside.


              For humans part of the outside process of maturing involves the discovery or

 establishment of the inside relationships with other humans with sites and with sacred

 elements. It would be possible to argue, though I have never heard it stated, that until one

 goes through this transformation to the outside, through it, and back inside, existence is in

 a kind of anomolous state without relationships and without awareness of one's identity,

 and that it is only by having the opportunity to come outside that the establishment of

 one's inside identity is possible.


             In conclusion then, Yolgu cosmology projects a cosmos which is an

 atemporal, two-sided, unbounded, network of entities incorporated in fixed relationships

 and with both inside and outside aspects, each of which can be discerned as a
. manifestation of the other, each a transformation of the other and with each being

 perceived as being analogous to the other. However it is a cosmos that is continually

 being discovered, as events occur which are interpreted as unknown aspects becoming

known, or the more inside aspects of the cosmos becoming established in the outside, the

 establishment of such aspects being treated as the evidence of both their inside and their

 atemporal existence.

        ORTHOGRAPHY USED FOR SPELLING OF YOLtjU
        WORDS.

             The orthography used throughout this thesis for spelling is that developed

by Beulah Lowe (1975). It has been adopted by the Yoluu communities for spelling

all the Yoluu languages and dialects. I have used it throughout this thesis as my best

attempt to represent the Yo}uu words in a way that enables them to be pronounced

with as much accuracy as possible. I describe the sounds for simplicity in the

following tables as they are taught to the non-Yo}uu members of the Northeast

Arnhem Land communities who attempt to use some of the Yo}uu language in an

effort to communicate more effectively with Yoluu people

      APPENDIX B.
      MYTH OF          YAWUL~A'S                 JOURNEY TO
      BURRALKU.

      (as narrated by Mathaman Marika at Yirrkala in 1967).

            This is the story of Yawul:gura, an old man who went to Burralku (the

place of the dead). He found mokuys there and returned to Caledon Bay , on this side.

He was ~aymil like Wadaymu and Larrtjan:ga.


            The mokuys (spirit beings I deceased humans) lit a fire at Burralku and

the gunguyu (ashes) came to Caledon Bay. Yawul:gura thought, "What's this?" when

he saw it falling at Caledon Bay on the beach. He though, "Where is this from?", then

he called his wives and told them that he'd found dirt (ashes) from fire ..

            "You get .uathu (cycad), and I'll make rope. Your djiima (work) rlikay

(swamp rush corms) and vathu and dhaniya (containers made from paper bark)."


            He made rope, very long, 2 or 3 miles. When it was all finished there

were three likirri (coils). Bark canoe ready. Took two women and left one on the

outside island, let out rope. Other women to stay.


            In the morning he took the two women and the food. They got to an

island called Djurrwanbuy and camped there for one or two days. There he found a

rock for an anchor, and he waited to see where the morning star rose. He saw it, and

marked that place. He thought, "Maybe there's a wii!]a (camp or place) there."


            In the morning he set off on his own with his food and water. He paddled

all day till sunset. He anchored there and slept. He woke up and checked the morning

star, then picked up his anchor and went on. The sun came out and he saw that sun

and went on always paddling. Might be three days, might be four, might be five days

like that, paddling all day, then put down the anchor and sleep at night.



                                              383
                                                                                     Appendix.

            Can't see that place galld (close to) Burralku. Might be three, four, five

days, and he look long wiripu (different I another) island. This one named

Gayawukawurru, close to Burralku. Dharrwa garriwa (many turtles I turtle eggs)

there and dharrwaganguri (many yams) there. (Might not be true). He took a little

stick and stuck it in the ground. This chased out a mokuy (a spirit being), and it

chased him back to the canoe. Dhuwala nyiiljun dhawu. (This is a lying story). "I

thought maybe turtle eggs, but I'll go now."


            One more day and he came to a big place with a long beach. (It was

Burralku). It was a seagull place and there were many there. Cat.chim wava (arrived at

the place). There were many porpoises there. He left the canoe, saw seagulls and

walked on. He saw footprints then went back and brought the canoe up close. He saw

many footprints mokuywu (belonging to the dead ones). Then he saw and heard

birrkpirrk (the masked plover) and thought "Maybe someone's coming from

somewhere and they've (the birds)heard them.


            He saw yol:gu coming . Their names were Mfilumbu and Y ambuyambu.

They were not happy for him. "Where's water?" he asked them. "Only rubbish,"they

replied. "Wanha waoa?(Where's the camp?)" he asked. "Long way, big path." they

replied. Nyiil'yun dhawu. (This is I was a lie).


            Then he saw guflurrku (brolga/s) and he heard the sound of a bll{}gul (a

ceremony with dancing and singing), so he painted himself with gapBf1 (white clay)

and took a different spear thrower with him (guymala). Wulambu I garrarrambu is the

Galpu [clan] name[for the spear thrower]. The birds looking at him thought

Yawul:gura was a mokuy yuja. (a newly dead person).


            Yawul:gura danced and sang yindi (big). The mokuys saw and talked

about his dancing. Some called out for his name. "Yawul:gura," he said. "Are you a

mokuy? (dead person)," they asked. "No! I'm alive." He danced the bll{}guls (dances),

1Ja!1umbirr(moming star), gugurrku (brolga) and birrkpirrk (plover), then he said,

"I'm going back to see my children, and I'll come back.


            He went back to the canoe, got djindjapana (porpoise meat), and galun (a

yam, Cayratia trifolia). Then he went back to the island and got the two women. They

were happy for him.


            In morning pickem up and go catchim up mainland and told them yindi

dhiiwu (the big story). He stayed for a little bit long time then went to look for turtle
eggs. He found some then went and camped in the shade of a tree. Made big fire -

cookim turtle egg-pinish -ate em, dharrwa (many), the lot- his stomach swell up-

him get very sick and died.


            Finished, and put im in ground, and his spirit went to Burralku like he

promised.

            Those dead ones went on, following up the sacred sites along the Wessel
Islands [with cross reference to peeling the fibre and piling up the bones (sticks from
which the bark has been peeled), making the turtle rope]. The creator of rope did it.

      APPENDIX D.
      MYTH OF THE TURTLE HARPOON ROPE.

      (As told by Djorrpum).

            Section 1. At the beginning of things, the ancestral beings made rope.

Mukarr is the name of those beings. They are also called Goliny; that is another name

for them. Mukarr went walking through the open forest and through the jungles

collecting rope fibre. They cut branches of the kurrajong trees, collecting them

together, piling them into a heap, collecting enough to make a long rope. Those

kurrajong trees had been growing there in all the country, and Mukarr collected the

fibre and brought it together in one place. Those Mukarr worked together, collecting

the Kurrajong branches and then peeling the fibrous bark from them.


            Section 2. Those Mukarr sat facing each other with the first strands of the

fibres tied to an upright forked stick. They sat facing each other with three strands,

passing them from hand to hand, twisting each strand as they passed it, causing each

to bind closely to the others, twisting into a single strong rope. They twisted and

passed adding new strands as the rope grew. It grew and grew, forming a coil on the

other side of the forked stick.


            Section 3.Twisting and turning it grew. Twisting and turning as the fibre

was used in its making, the rope grew.They worked together,peeling, peeling, laying

the bark fibres out to dry, throwing the wood to one side.

            Section 4. The pile of sticks grew and grew. Finally all the fibre is used.

That rope is complete now. It lies waiting,ready for action, ready for the hunt, ready to

go out and get turtle. Mukarr binds it to a harpoon made from the wood of the stringy

bark tree. He binds it on with strong fibres. To the other end of the rope he ties a big

float of wuguku.




                                              388
                                                                                        Appendix.

             Section 5. He carries it to the canoe, completed, ready to go. The tide is

ready now, the sea is still, the rope lies quietly in the bow of the canoe. Mukarr sets

out on his journey, paddling, paddling, paddling. The rope lies waiting.Mukarr stands

in the bow of the canoe watching, looking for turtle. The rope lies quietly at his feet

"there is turtle, over there." They paddle quietly closer. Mukarr stands motionless,

harpoon poised, steady ... go .... The rope coils out into the water, at one with the

harpoon tip. It grips the turtle firmly and strongly, feeling the wetness as the water

bubbles past. This is joyous excitement. This is the purpose for existence. The

buoyant float on the other end of the rope is holding back, dragging on the turtle,

tiring it, overcoming it, forcing it to come to the surface for breath. Mukarr is

following, watching the float. The turtle dives with insufficient breath; the rope

continues to hold him. Weakened, the turtle lies gasping on the surface. Mukarr is

there pulling in the rope. He has the turtle. Mukarr lifts it into the canoe. He is a

skillful hunter.


             Section 6. Those Mukarr are returning now, back to the beach, quietly

paddling but exultant, a turtle is in the canoe. That which he has created, the rope, is

truly effective. The rope lies there again in the canoe, quietly resting. It has fulfilled its

purpose admirably, with skill and strength. That rope is perfection.


             Section 7. They have returned now, the turtle is cooked, the hunt is over.

Relaxing. The rope lies dry, coiled up on the sand. The Mukarr are lying there beside

the rope - satisfied - complete. The sun has gone below the horizon on its journey

back to the east. The dark tropical rain clouds stand pink-tinged and glowing in the

sky. There is a wall of rain standing below them on the horizon. All is completed, the

day, the hunt, the task.


             Section 8. The very purpose of the creation is fulfilled. It is done.

APPENDIX E.
STORY OF THE JOURNEY TAKEN BY THE
DECEASED IN ORDER TO REACH BURRALKU.

(As told by Djiniyini)

      This is really the journey taken by the Birrimbirr of a person after he dies,

but there are some people who refer to it by the term mokuy, because that is the

name we give to the corpse of a dead person. The final rituals have to be right to

give the spirit the correct directions for his journey.


      At first when a person dies and just after the burial the spirit is still around

the place where the death occurred. For two or three nights the relatives will

try/test to see if it will indicate its presence in some way. If they do not hear

from it they know it has taken its journey, that it has jumped in the canoe and

paddled to Burralku.


      On the journey there is a place where the spirit meets opposition. Mostly

this opposition comes from winyiwinyi (small bats), which try to misdirect the

birrimbirr onto the wrong path. If it is not wise it will be misdirected and return

to the place where it died. If it is wise it knows how to protect itself and gets to

another place where there is a water hole.


      At this second place it meets clifferent people who are singing. The songs

that these people are singing are the echo of the songs that were sung at his

funeral. He waits for one particular song, that of the morning star. When he

hears them singing morning star and he also sees it, he then paddles off

following the star to Burralku.


      On this final stage of the journey he sees the things that were sung for him

at his funeral. He sees things like birrkpirrk, gugjgj, baripari (three bird species)

and mokuy !Jatha (food eaten by spirit beings) and is happy because he is close

to home.


      Upon arrival at Burralku he is tested by two mokuy (dead ones) who

check to see that he has had his nose pierced, and they look at his teeth because

one of them should be missing. (This was a Macassan tradition). If he passes

they say to him, "Go and drink the clean water prepared for you". If however he

fails to pass he is told to go and drink yiitjkurru (bad/rotten) water. and then if

he has not passed he is sent back and becomes a wakinIJu mokuy (an uncivilised

spirit being) and stays around the earth trying to steal the spirits of other people

when they die. These uncivilised spirits are also known by the term Gurrka-

gapumi (Literally penis having water).

1.Yes this is the story, but I will tell it in Djambarrpu~u language because it
will be easier for brother to understand it Yes the story is about that place
Gundalmirri. At Gundalmirri there was working that spirit being named Go:o-

and woman's (or wife's) name is Ma!umbu. He was working at that place
Gundalmirri making the morning star He was singing, and that singing for
Banumbirr spoiled his wife's sleep and she (Ma!umbu), was crying because of
Banumbirr. Her sleep was spoiled and shewas crying for Banumbirr, for its

      APPENDIX G.
      SUMMARY OF WARNER'S VERSION OF THE
      BANUMBIRR MYTH.

             A Gfilpu clansman (his Kalpu) named Yawuluura (his Ya-ol-ngur-a) has

a leaf brought to him from the East from beyond the sea. He goes on a journey of

seven days by canoe to find that country ,at the end of the third day he reaches an

island where he is able to re-provision with bird's eggs, then on the fourth day after

that finally reaches Burralku (his Pu-rel-ko), being guided in the last part of the

journey by the light of the morning star.


             At Burralku he meets the mokuy (his mokois = ghosts), sings for them

and they dance. He is given "three of the best" of the young ghost women and then

says, "I want to see your morning star". This is owned and controlled by an old

woman named Mfilumbu (his Mar-lum-bu), and kept in her basket. He tries all night

using persuasion and she cries, knowing she will have to show him because he sings

"magical songs" including the singing of her own name. At this point she takes it out

of her basket and is quoted as saying (p526) "I'll show you this one. It comes from

this Island of Perelko. Do you see this big part of it? They are sea-gull feathers. And

this other part is the jungle yam." To which he replies, "It is just the same as the one

we dance with in our Barnumbir ceremony. Mine, too, is made of sea-gull feathers

and of the yam." He holds it and then gives it back and sings the Banumbirr song, and
the old woman turns it loose. It flies up, still attached to its string, alights first on a tall
pandanus tree, then flies when Yawuluura sings Melville Island it flies there Melville

Island


             The star's journey (Warner declares it to be "a woman because her

mistress is a woman") then includes "Ka-ral-tja" in the English company Islands, to

the mainland where the "Naladaer" people live near Buckingham Bay and then to

Elcho Island where she finds "Marungun" people. At this point it starts to become

. daylight and the old woman pulls her back on the string and putting it in her basket,
curls around it and goes to sleep.

             Yawuluura decides to go and get his family and bring them to Burralku.
There is an exchange of gifts between him and the head man of the ghosts. They
provision his canoe and he returns the way he came. He is welcomed home by his
children and wives, and feeds them with the provisions he has brought with him.

             That night he breaks his back as he copulates with one of his wives, his
 backbone having been weakened because the ghost wives had stolen his spirit. His
human wives mourn his death and his soul returns "to the Perelko ghost women who
waited for him and saw his return".

7. Question: Where (did they throw it) to?

Answer: To here. It makes daylight, and there the sea becomes coloured by it

at Marayuma and its daylight comes here and it becomes dawn. For

Banumbirr, (daylight) will be here. And that the way the story goes. Yes,

      APPENDIX I.
      WULUWUMA AND THE ORIGIN OF THE MORNING
      STAR

      (As described by Yalkarriwuy)

            Yalkarriwuy said that the morning star was made first by Wuluwuma. He

saw the morning star in the sky and sat singing, ''Dar', dar', dar' ".At !'jandjiJJur, (the

other side ofYirrkala), he sat and djiima (work/ make). He's the gapti.n/bu.ggawa

(leader) for my place (named GakupaJJur). Wuluwuma lives in a jungle named

Dulmana/Gayku/Watharraka, where there are many ganguri(ayam species), and

that is his food. He walks through the jungle looking up for the yam flowers.

Ganguri djii.mamirri vayi (He is a ganguri yam maker I worker I gatherer). Banumal I
Ganinyigi I Dhurrtjithurrtji is the name of the digging stick for digging ganguri. It is a

very long stick with both ends sharp.


            When the Banumbirr (Morning Star) pole is made, the whole object also

is ganguri. The long tassels decorated with lindirritj (rainbow lorikeet) feathers

represent the creeper of the yam. Feathered clumps on the end of the tassels are djuku,

(lice/fleas) that live on the plant. The stripes on the pole are the same as those on

wurrka.gi (unidentified grub or maggot). Names for the pole are guyu!un I
maypunumburr I yigirrwa. Names for the mokuy (dead one) are Dhanbul I

Wugulauiny I Yuwaypuma I Manyguluma I Nyigila. Wava (place) for Banumbirr is

Burralku/Dhunumbiyala.


            The birdgukuk/laparr(a dove) talks to the mokuy(deadone) saying

guk, guk, and tells the location of the yams.


            Lots of people use Banumbirr for the buvgul (ceremony). When I make

Banumbirr, I work right and use bush turkey buJpuJ.(feathers) Gurrkurr(strings

/sinews) vayi (it) yam. Gugurrku (brolga) is buvgan (odour I essence) nhanrJu (for

him) Wuluwuma, also bonba (butterfly) and gukuk (Bar-shouldered dove). Milkmilk

(mosquito) named gB!J.amu, burakina uanya (mosquito sp. pierced him) and he went

slapping it. At Maningrida they make Banumbirr with a long raki (string).


             Wuluwuma is the name for the mokuy (dead one) from fresh water, fliltji

(bush) side and Yauurryauurr is his name from the salt water nqJi (beach) side. Both

areGfilpu.


             Wurrkagi (an unidentified grub or perhaps maggot) lives in the ground

and eats and spoils ganguri (yam). In paintings of wurrkafli, the "holes" are where
wurrkafli goes in. The holes are also the place where we put items used in cleaning
wounds. Gululultja I wurrkafli comes to them.
