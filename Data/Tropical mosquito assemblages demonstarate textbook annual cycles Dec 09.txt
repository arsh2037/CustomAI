Abstract
Background: Annual biological rhythms are often depicted as predictably cyclic, but quantitative evaluations are few and
rarely both cyclic and constant among years. In the monsoon tropics, the intense seasonality of rainfall frequently drives
fluctuations in the populations of short-lived aquatic organisms. However, it is unclear how predictably assemblage
composition will fluctuate because the intensity, onset and cessation of the wet season varies greatly among years.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Adult mosquitoes were sampled using EVS suction traps baited with carbon dioxide
around swamplands adjacent to the city of Darwin in northern Australia. Eleven sites were sampled weekly for five years,
and one site weekly for 24 years, the sample of c. 1.4 million mosquitoes yielding 63 species. Mosquito abundance, species
richness and diversity fluctuated seasonally, species richness being highly predictable. Ordination of assemblage
composition demonstrated striking annual cycles that varied little from year to year. The mosquito assemblage was
temporally structured by a succession of species peaks in abundance.
Conclusion/Significance: Ordination provided strong visual representation of annual rhythms in assemblage composition
and the means to evaluate variability among years. Because most mosquitoes breed in shallow freshwater which fluctuates
with rainfall, we did not anticipate such repeatability; we conclude that mosquito assemblage composition appears adapted
to predictable elements of the rainfall.

others have focussed on adaptive responses to the underlying
seasonality [8,9].
Organisms whose lifespan is less than the relevant environmental periodicity can respond rapidly to the onset and/or
prolongation of favourable conditions regardless of their predictability [10]. Tropical mosquitoes undergo several to many
generations per year and can reproduce prolifically [11]. As their
larvae and pupae are obligately aquatic, and development is
affected little by temperature variations encountered in tropical
lowlands, they are ideal subjects with which to identify
relationships between rainfall and abundance.
Here, we examine seasonal and among-year variation in the
composition of mosquito assemblages from the monsoon tropics
using an extensive long-term monitoring dataset, and demonstrate
strikingly cyclic patterns that vary little from year to year
regardless of among-year variation in rainfall.

Introduction
Annual rhythms are a fundamental biological response to the
seasons. They arise when organisms time growth, reproduction
and dispersal to make optimal use of predictable seasonal events
[1,2]. As an aggregate affect across many species, community
(assemblage) structure may also fluctuate seasonally in a
predictable manner [3]. However, environments are frequently
unpredictable and complex biotic interactions may overwhelm
rhythmic responses. Nevertheless, annual rhythms are often
depicted and interpreted as cyclic and constant from year to year,
but quantitative demonstrations are few and rarely both cyclic and
repeatable.
Highly predictable variation in day-length underpins seasonality
in temperate regions, but in the tropics day-length varies little and
rainfall assumes a much greater role in defining seasons. However,
rainfall is inherently less predictable than day-length. Most tropical
regions experience a monsoonal climate characterised by intense
seasonality of rainfall (summer wet – winter dry) [4], but
paradoxically the monsoon tropics has the greatest annual
variability in rainfall in the world [5]. This paradox has profound
and unresolved implications for the region’s biota. Whilst some
biologists have emphasized flexibility in life histories and
behaviour as adaptations to life in the monsoon tropics [6,7],

Methods
Biology of Tropical Mosquitoes
Female mosquitoes can lay from 30–300 eggs per oviposition
episode and may have a number of oviposition episodes,
depending on age and food requirements. In the tropics, most
species complete several to many generations per year, life cycles

generally being completed in from 1.5–5 weeks [11]. Although
development rates are sensitive to variations in temperature, the
range of temperatures encountered in the lowland tropics drives
variation in rates that is measured in days rather than months
[12,13]. Most tropical mosquitoes lack any dormancy mechanism,
the major exception being the tribe Aedini (includes the genera
Aedes and Verrallina), whose eggs can be resistant to desiccation for
months or even years. Aedini eggs are laid on moist substrates and
depend on subsequent immersion for hatching and subsequent
larval development [14].

Study Area and Mosquito Surveys
Mosquito populations were monitored at eleven woodland sites
between the coastal city of Darwin (12u279 S, 130u509; Northern
Territory, Australia) and the freshwater and tidal wetlands that
almost surround the city [15]. With 88% of the mean annual
rainfall of 1708 mm falling in the five ‘summer’ months (Nov. –
March) at a mean rate of 9.9 mm d21 (Figure 1a), the city’s
climate far exceeds the 55% and 3 mm d21 thresholds employed
to define a monsoonal climate [4]. Marked variation among years
in rainfall, especially during the transitional months, affects the
length of the ‘green’ season by up to three months [16,17], but
cumulative rainfall (Figure 1b) provides reliable annual saturation
of soils.
Temperatures are high throughout the year. Mean monthly
maxima range from 30uC in July to 33uC in October to December
and in April, whilst mean monthly minima range from 19uC in
July to 25uC from October to February [18]. In most years,
overnight temperatures do not drop below 15uC. Day-length
varies annually from 11.2 to 12.9 hours, with global radiation
remaining relatively constant throughout the year because on the
inverse seasonal relationship between cloud cover and potential
solar radiation [18].
The number and identity of blood-seeking adult female
mosquitoes were monitored overnight once per week at 11 sites
for five years (2001 to 2005; 2,871 trap-nights), and weekly at one
of these sites for 24 years (Palm Creek, 1982 to 2005; 1,253 trapnights)), using suction traps baited with carbon dioxide. These
were standard EVS CO2-baited mosquito traps [19] which detect
a wide range of species [20]. Palm Creek was selected for longterm analysis because it offers the combination of long-term data
with little human environmental change in its mosquito catchment
area.
Samples were frozen after collection for later identification by
the staff of Medical Entomology of the Department of Health and
Families in Darwin. Samples of less than 300 individuals were
identified and counted fully. For larger catches, the full catch and a
sub-sample of c. 300 specimens were weighed and the sub-sample
fully identified and enumerated. The sample was checked for
species absent from the sub-sample. The ratio of weights provided
a conversion factor to estimate the total number of individuals of
each species in the sample. The abundance of a species present in
the sample but absent from the sub-sample was scored as the total
number present in the sample.

index ranges from 0 (low diversity) to almost 1, a high diversity
score indicating both greater species richness and relatively little
variation among species in their abundance [21].
Each data set was then ordinated. Ordination is a form of data
reduction applicable to multi-dimensional data sets. Assemblages
or communities of species may be envisaged as points in an ndimensional hypervolume in which each dimension represents the
abundance of a species, and the Euclidean distance between pairs
of points is a measure of the dissimilarity of those assemblages. In
ordination, one seeks to reduce the number of dimensions for ease
of interpretation – usually but not necessarily to one to three
dimensions – whilst retaining as much of the original distance
information as possible. Non-metric multidimensional scaling
(MDS or NMDS) is a robust non-parametric form of ordination

Data Analysis
For both the 11-sites and Palm Creek datasets, weekly counts/
estimates of the abundance of each species were averaged up to
months (n = 60 and 288 months respectively), the former after
combining sites into a single dataset. The resulting two datasets
each comprise a matrix of species by months. For each month in
the 11-sites data set, we summed the estimated number of
mosquitoes and number of mosquito species, and calculated
species diversity using Simpson’s Diversity Index. This diversity

[22] with wide application to the analysis of species assemblages,
including the analysis of change to ecological communities [23].
We chose MDS because our species assemblage abundance scores
are strongly skewed by an abundance of zeros and thus not
normally distributed. MDS has previously been used to represent
annual cycles in assemblage composition [3,24].
Computationally, the first step is to calculate a triangular matrix
of dissimilarity among all pairs of samples. The Bray-Curtis
distance measure is appropriate for assemblage data because it
gives no weight to zero/zero (mutual absence) data. It ranges from
0 (identical) to 1 (no overlap), and is calculated as:

Results
Five years of data from 11 trap sites yielded 56 species from an
estimated 617,272 mosquitoes, of which 334,291 (54%) were
identified. In some years, mosquito abundance peaked early in the
wet season and again early in the dry season, but in all years was
low later in the wet season and later in the dry season (Figure 2a).
Species richness varied predictably with time of year, peaking in
the wet-dry transition (April – 33.8 species61.92 SD) and
bottoming in the dry-wet transition (October – 18.8 species61.79
SD) (Figure 2b). Diversity was consistently high from late in the
wet season (March) to mid-late dry season (August) but highly
variable in the dry-wet transtion and early to middle wet season

where BC = the Bray Curtis index of dissimilarity; Xij, Xik = the
number of individuals of species i in the samples j and k; and
n = the number of species in the samples [21]. MDS then seeks
solutions for pre-determined levels of dimensionality whilst
miminising stress using iterative selection of steepest descent in
stress. Stress is ‘‘a measure of difference in monotonicity in the
relationship between’’ the original and reduced dimensional
dissimilarity matrices [25], and is thus greatest when the number
of dimensions is least. Solution axes provide relative scaling of final
dissimilarity but are otherwise arbitrary. The cloud of points may
thus be rotated around their centroid (the mean of axis scores),
allowing one to align maximum linear variance in the ordination
with an axis for further consideration – a process known as
varimax rotation.
For the purpose of ordination, mosquito species present in fewer
than four samples were excluded, leaving 43 species in each
dataset [26]. Monthly species data were ln(x+1)-transformed to
reduce the overwhelming effect of a few abundant species.
Ordination was undertaken in the software PC-ORD 4.01 [25]
using the Bray-Curtis distance measure and MDS. Four hundred
iterations were allowed to generate minimum-stress solutions.
Outputs were evaluated in from 1 to 6 dimensions and the optimal
dimensionality identified as that in which the stress was
significantly (P,0.05) better than random and in which the
addition of another dimension reduced ordination stress only
slightly. The 11-site ordination was repeated with different
random starting coordinates to check for robustness. The solutions
presented have been subject to varimax rotation.
To identify the species influencing ordination structure, a biplot
vector for each species was fitted through the ordination centroid
[25]. Ordination points (months) are scored for the point on the
line to which they are perpendicular, and the correlation between
this position and the species’ abundance calculated. The vector is
rotated around the ordination centroid to optimise the correlation.
For each species, the optimal correlation was evaluated for
significance (P,0.05) after application of the sequential Bonferroni
correction for the number of species in the ordination.
Species represented by a significant biplot vector in the 11-site
ordination were characterised for breeding site ecological
attributes (salinity: brackish/salt cf freshwater; waterbody type:
temporary pools cf containers cf permanent or semi-permanent
waterbodies). The angle of biplot vectors was used as a measure of
the seasonal peak of each species, and mean seasonal peaks of
attribute groups evaluated with Watson-Williams (circular) F-tests.
Species belonging to more than one attribute group were excluded
from analysis. Post-hoc evaluations of waterbody types were pairwise with a Bonferroni correction.

season than those of permanent or semi-permanent waterbodies
(Watson-Williams F = 12.3, d.f. = 2,35, P,0.001).
At Palm Creek, an estimated 788,840 mosquitoes were collected,
of which 38.3% (302,895) were identified, also comprising 56
species. A two-dimensional ordination solution (Figure 4) was
optimal and robust (stress = 12.5; random stress = 32.1). The
solution retained 92.5% of the original variance (axis 1–79.2%;
axis 2–13.3%). Calendar months were non-randomly grouped
(Mantel randomisation test, P,0.001). Variation among years was
markedly greater than for the 11-sites (5 year) ordination but
summary of axis coordinates (mean 6 standard deviation)
nevertheless retrieved a clear and similar annual cycle.
Both ordinations illustrate that the composition of the mosquito
assemblage was most predictable at the end of the wet season and
least so at the end of the dry season, aligned with Axis 1, and that
the greatest annual contrasts in assemblage composition were
between these times.

(Figure 2c), the latter reflecting the propensity for a few species to
establish vast numerical preponderance at these times.
A two-dimensional ordination solution (Figure 3a) was optimal
and robust (stress = 7.8; random stress = 31.5), with repeat
ordination yielding an identical result. The solution retained
96.4% of the original variance (axis 1–72.3%; axis 2–24.1%).
Calendar months were non-randomly grouped (Mantel randomisation test, P = 0.001) and demonstrated a striking annual cycle
with little variation among years. All species included displayed
significant (P,0.05 with sequential Bonferroni correction) linear
radial correlations with the 5-year ordination (Figure 3b). Most
species peaked between January and June. Brackish/saltwater
specialists peaked earlier in the wet season than freshwater
specialists (Watson-Williams F = 15.3, d.f = 36, P,0.001). Species
that breed in transient pools or containers peaked earlier in the wet

Discussion
Ordination of these mosquito assemblages has depicted
strikingly predictable annual cycles. These were driven by a
succession of species peaks in abundance and predictable seasonal
variation in species richness. Notwithstanding the intensely
monsoonal climate, many species persisted as adults throughout
the year, probably by continuous breeding in refugia as for Culex
and Anopheles species [27]. Predictable cycles occurred notwithstanding the irruptive tendencies of a few species [28,29]. We
acknowledge minimizing the impact of irruptive tendencies on our
ordinations by logarithmic transformation of abundance, but note
that fundamental changes in community compostion (e.g. rare
species becomes common or vice versa) will still strongly influence
ordination position. We believe that irruptions by a few medicallyimportant species have clouded perceptions of system predictability. Our data show that major mosquito irruptions occurred with
the cessation and especially the onset of the wet season – and are
thus in themselves relatively predictable in timing – and that they
do not substantially influence overall assemblage composition.
Ordination has been recommended for the analysis of temporal
change in community structure [23]. Quantitative measures of
variation among years may be derived from locations in ordination
space, for example as area of the minimum convex polygon
(Figure 3a), as measures of variance in axis scores (Figure 4), or
with the variety of more sophisticated methods for calculating area

or volume developed for the analysis of faunal home ranges [30].
Ordinations of time series of the composition of other species
assemblages have yielded less striking and/or less repeatable
annual cycles; the best we could identify being for fish and
crustaceans monitored monthly for four years in a Florida estuary
[24]. Other interesting examples are for the fish fauna of an
estuary in Belgium [31], and for crustaceans in a Spanish estuary
[3]. In none of these cases, nor any other that we have located, was
among-year variation quantified.
It is doubtless no coincidence that the above examples are all
estuarine. The marine environment is relatively buffered against
short-term and unpredictable variation in environmental conditions. Deep freshwater aquatic environments may also be so
buffered but shallow and riparian habitats, such as where most
mosquitoes breed, are highly responsive to rainfall, especially in
the extreme climate of the monsoonal tropics. The mosquitoes in
our study mostly breed in shallow (,200 mm) freshwater, with a
few species breeding in deeper water to 1 m associated with
aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation, and some in tidally influenced
environments. It is surprising, therefore, that the Darwin mosquito
assemblage displayed such organised and repeatable temporal
structure. The predictable seasonality of the monsoon is the

overwhelming influence on assemblage composition. We interpret
the seasonal succession of species in this study as indicating fine
environmental partitioning adapted to predictable rainfall elements [1], a product of the diversity of niches available [32] and
possibly a long ecological and evolutionary history [9].
Predictable annual cycles may be anticipated in environments
where assemblages are structured directly by seasonal, tidal or
daylight rhythms. Ironically but most usefully, they may provide
sensitive indicators of changing climates [33] because they are
relatively insensitive to short-term climatic aberrations.
