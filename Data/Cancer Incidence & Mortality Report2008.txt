Summary
In the Northern Territory (NT) the Northern Territory Cancer Registry (NTCR) collects data
about NT residents who are either diagnosed with cancer or die from cancer. The NTCR
analyses and reports the data to provide information for health service planning and delivery,
as well as for informing the general public.

In this report summary statistics are presented on all new cases of cancer diagnosed among
NT residents during the 15-year period 1991–2005 and on all cancer deaths during the 13-
year period 1991–2003. Equivalent summary statistics for the Australian population are
included for comparative purposes. Additionally, for the first time graphical representation of
trends in NT cancer incidence and mortality rates are provided for each cancer site. To allow
comparison of incidence rates and deaths rates within the NT population and with the wider
Australian population, the rates were adjusted for the increase in total populations and for
the changing age profile within the populations.

Key findings
•   A total of 6063 new cases of cancer were diagnosed among NT residents (3478 males
    and 2585 females) during the 15-year period 1991–2005. The majority of cases occurred
    among non-Indigenous Territorians (4907), with the remainder in the Indigenous
    population (1156). The average number of new cancer cases diagnosed each year in the
    NT increased from 313 in the early 90s to 494 for the period 2001–2005.

•   During the 13-year period 1991–2003, a total of 2116 NT residents died from cancer,
    including 1273 males and 843 females, or 647 Indigenous and 1469 non-Indigenous.
    The average number of cancer deaths rose from 151 per year during the 90s to 173 per
    year during the most recent period 2001–2003.

•   There was a downward trend in the all cancer incidence rate among non-Indigenous
    Territorians, while by contrast the trend among Indigenous Territorians increased.

•   Similarly the all cancer death rate among the non-Indigenous population declined
    significantly over time, but there was little change in the all cancer death rate of
    Indigenous people.

•   Lung cancer was the leading type of cancer among NT Indigenous men and prostate
    cancer among non-Indigenous men. Breast cancer was the leading type of cancer
    among both NT Indigenous and NT non-Indigenous women.

•   The death rate due to lung cancer was the highest among all Territorians and exceeded
    other cancers by a considerable margin. In each population group the lung cancer death
    rate was more than double that of the second placed cancer.

•   Certain major cancers declined markedly in incidence over time, the most notable being
    lung cancer among non-Indigenous men (47%) and cervical cancer among all NT women
    (61%). Other cancers increased in incidence over time including prostate cancer among
    non-Indigenous men (87%) and breast cancer among Indigenous women (110%). The
    breast cancer rate for Indigenous woman is now more than half the rate for non-
    Indigenous women.

•    While the death rates due to some cancers increased slightly over time, none were
     statistically significant. By contrast there were substantial and statistically significant
     declines in cancer death rates for other cancer types. This included the decline in lung
     cancer death rates among all non-Indigenous Territorians (43%), and declines for
     melanoma and pancreatic cancer death rates among non-Indigenous men (84% and
     77% respectively). Among NT women, there was a 64% decline in cervical cancer death
     rates among NT non-Indigenous women and a even greater 92% decline among
     Indigenous women.




    2 NT   CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY
1 Introduction
Background
This report presents summary cancer incidence and mortality statistics, including time
trends, for the population of the Northern Territory (NT). Northern Territory cancer incidence
statistics are provided for the period 1991-2005 and cancer mortality for 1991-2003. The
term ‘cancer’ refers to all invasive malignant tumours or neoplasms, but does not include
non-melanocytic skin cancer or in-situ cancers. Because cancer incidence and mortality for
Indigenous people are very different to other Australians, cancer statistics are presented for
the total NT population and separately for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Territorians.1 Total
Australian cancer incidence and mortality statistics are also presented for comparison,
although for slightly different periods. Australian cancer incidence statistics are provided for
the period 1991-2001 and mortality for 1991-2003.

Northern Territory cancer incidence statistics comprise all new cases of cancer diagnosed as
a primary site among NT residents. These include residents who were diagnosed interstate,
and notified to the Northern Territory Cancer Registry (NTCR). The mortality statistics
comprise all NT residents whose underlying cause of death was recorded as cancer,
regardless of whether the death occurred in the NT or elsewhere in Australia.

The term cancer in this report refers to all invasive malignant tumours or neoplasms but does
not include non-melanocytic skin cancer (NMSC) or in-situ cancers. The NTCR collects
information about in-situ breast and cervical cancers and squamous-cell carcinomas (SCC)
of the lip and anus, however these cancers are excluded from reporting because they are
either not yet malignant (in-situ cancers), or are very common and rarely fatal (non-
melanocytic skin cancers).

Grouping of specific cancer sites in this report are the same as those used in national cancer
incidence and mortality reports produced by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
(AIHW).2 The exceptions to this are some cancer sites such as cancer of lip, oral cavity and
pharynx (see Appendix 2). Cancers occurring in these sites are grouped together to diminish
random variations caused by small numbers of cases in the NT. Vulval cancer, on the other
hand, is presented separately because of its particular relevance to the NT.

This report consists of an overview of cancer incidence and mortality in Chapter Two and
statistical tables for all cancers combined and for individual cancer sites in Chapter Three.
Incidence and mortality statistics are provided separately for each site and/or group, and by
sex and Indigenous status for each period as well as trends over time.

Background information about the operation of the NTCR can be found in a related
publication, Northern Territory Cancer Registry: Data Collection, Analysis and Reporting
Procedures.3 This publication details the statistical methods used in preparing this report,
except for additional or corrected methods, which are presented in Appendix 1.

Methods
Statistical measures shown in this report include numbers of cases and deaths, relative
proportion, crude and age-standardised rates, lifetime risk (0-74 years), and person-years of
life lost (0-74 years) rate from cancer death.

Incidence and mortality rates are the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 population. We
used the 2001 Australian Estimated Resident Population (ERP) to adjust for differences in
age structures of the Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.

Person-years of life lost (PYLL) is the total number of years of life lost per annum from
deaths occurring among people aged less than 75 years due to a specific cause, whereas
the PYLL rate is the total number of years of life lost per annum for every 100,000 people of
this age group. The higher the PYLL rate the higher the extent of premature deaths due to
each cause in the population. The PYLL rate is a more meaningful measurement than PYLL
for comparison between population groups, and for this reason both PYLL and PYLL rates
were shown in this report.

Trends in cancer incidence and mortality are shown in figures as trend lines and in tables as
average annual and overall rates of change. We estimated trends in cancer incidence over
fifteen years and in cancer mortality over thirteen years by using a negative binomial
regression model. The model generated the average annual rate of change (the rate ratio) in
cancer incidence and mortality rate for each cancer site, by sex and Indigenous status.

The trend lines were constructed using the average annual incidence or mortality rate and
the average annual rate of change as the exponential factor. For the most part the trend
lines were effective in demonstrating changes over time, but for several trends, which were
not statistically significant, the trend lines were unable to demonstrate changes over time.

The average annual rate of change for cancer incidence or mortality was expressed as the
percentage change per year while the overall rate of change was estimated over the entire
combined period, either 15 years for incidence or 13 years for mortality. Although not all data
were available for these periods, the estimate was calculated on the basis that the same
average annual rate of change in the available period was assumed to continue through to
the final year, either 2003 or 2005. This was done so that changes in incidence and mortality
between all population groups could be compared.




 4 NT    CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY
Limitations
There are two major limitations to the statistics provided in this report:

   1. There is an over-estimate in non-Indigenous’ cancer incidence rates by 2-3% and an
      under-estimate in Indigenous’ by 15-20%. These figures were derived during a data
      quality assessment of the NTCR for the period 1991–2001, and attributed to under-
      ascertainment of cases and, more importantly, misclassification of Indigenous status
      in NT cancer registrations.4


   2. The population in the NT, especially the Indigenous population, is small and relatively
      young compared to the total Australian population (see Appendix 3). In 2001 for
      example the NT population was comprised of 198,000 people with only 5% aged 65
      years and over. As a result, fewer than 500 new cases of cancers are registered in
      the NT each year. Random variation in the annual number of cancer cases and
      deaths, particularly for less common cancer sites, can be considerable and may be
      responsible for differences in incidence and mortality rates among population groups.
      Random variation may also be responsible for small alterations in trends over time for
      incidence or mortality rates. To address this we provide 95% confidence intervals for
      age-standardised incidence and mortality rates and for estimated annual changes of
      these rates.

2 Cancer incidence and mortality in the
Northern Territory
All cancers combined
Cancer was more frequently diagnosed among men in the NT than women. Between 1991
and 2005 there were 6063 new cases of cancer diagnosed, of which 3478 were males and
2585 females. The average annual age-standardised cancer incidence rates were 487 cases
per 100,000 population for males and 360 for females.

Indigenous Territorians had a lower incidence of cancer than non-Indigenous Territorians. Of
the 6063 new cases, 1156 cases were Indigenous (356 cases per 100,000 population) and
4907 were non-Indigenous (451 cases per 100,000 population).

Cancer was a major cause of deaths in the NT accounting for 20% of all deaths in 2001.5
During the period 1991 to 2003, cancer was the underlying cause of death for 2116 NT
residents, 1273 of whom were males and 843 females. The average annual age-
standardised cancer death rates were 265 deaths per 100,000 population for males and 187
for females.

Indigenous Territorians were more likely to die from cancer than non-Indigenous Territorians
during the 13-year period. Although the difference in cancer death rate was not marked it
was statistically significant. Of the 2116 cancer deaths 647 were Indigenous (269 deaths per
100,000 population) and 1469 non-Indigenous (219 deaths per 100,000 population).

With the exception of people aged 75 years and above, Indigenous age-specific cancer
death rates were higher in all age groups than non-Indigenous. The consequence being
much a higher PYLL rate among Indigenous Territorians of both sexes, but particularly
Indigenous women. For Indigenous women the PYLL rate was almost double that of non-
Indigenous women.

Most common cancer sites
In this report the order of cancer sites was ranked according to age-standardised incidence
rates. This methodology was used rather than ranking by actual numbers or proportional
distribution because age-standardised rates provide a fairer comparison between
populations with different age structures.

During the period 1991–2005, cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung (lung cancer)
dominated as the most common cancer among Indigenous men. Following in 2nd and 3rd
rank were cancers of unspecified sites and cancer of the lip, oral cavity and pharynx.
Similarly cancer of the prostate (prostate cancer) dominated among non-Indigenous men
while the next ranked cancers; lung cancer and cancer of the colon and rectum (colorectal
cancer) trailed well behind.

Cancer of the breast (breast cancer) was the most common cancer diagnosed in all NT
women, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. For Indigenous women lung cancer ranked
second marginally behind breast cancer, while cancers of unspecified sites followed close
behind in third place. In contrast breast cancer was the leading cancer by far among non-
Indigenous women followed by colorectal cancer and lung cancer, both of which were
considerably fewer in incidence than breast cancer.

 6 NT   CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY
Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in the NT as whole, and in all population
groups; both men and women, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. Cancers of unspecified sites
and cancer of the liver (liver cancer) were the next leading causes of cancer death among
Indigenous men while prostate and colorectal cancers prevailed ion as 2nd and 3rd ranked
causes among non-Indigenous men. For women, breast and cervical cancer were the next
leading causes among Indigenous females and colorectal and breast cancers among non-
Indigenous females.

Analysis by Indigenous status
The incidence of liver, cervical and vulva cancer among Indigenous people in the NT was
much higher that of non-Indigenous people. These cancers are largely preventable through
hepatitis B vaccination and Pap smear programs.6 For a variety of reasons participation in
cervical screening programs by Indigenous women has always lagged behind non-
Indigenous women and may account for the marked difference in cervical and vulva
incidence. Despite the lag, participation by Indigenous women is reported to have improved
in recent times,7 which is consistent with the decline in cervical cancer incidence and
mortality.

On the other hand, Indigenous people overall had a much lower incidence of melanoma,
colorectal and kidney cancer compared to other Territorians as well as lower rates of sex-
specific cancers such as prostate and testis in men and breast in women.

Comparison to Australia
Relative to the Australia, the NT as a whole had a lower cancer incidence rate but a higher
cancer mortality rate. These differences are in part due to a more youthful population
compared to Australia and in part due to a proportionately large Indigenous population. The
consequences of more advanced cancer at diagnosis, as well as poorer treatment outcomes
and other disadvantages of lower socio-economic status are known to impact upon the
cancer survival rate of the NT Indigenous population.8

Analysis of cancer incidence and mortality by Indigenous status revealed that the NT non-
Indigenous cancer profile was relatively similar to that of the Australian population whereas
the profile for Indigenous Territorians was markedly different. The exceptions to this were
smoking-related cancers. Lung and lip cancer incidence and mortality rates were higher
among all Territorians; men and women, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, than Australians
as a whole. The NT has the highest prevalence of tobacco smoking in Australia and the link
between smoking and these particular cancers is well documented.9

Trends
During the period 1991–1995 an average of 313 cases of cancer were diagnosed per year in
the NT but by 2001–2005 the yearly average had increased to 494. However population
growth offset the rise in non-Indigenous cases to such an extent that cancer incidence
declined among non-Indigenous people across the two periods. In contrast the rise in
Indigenous cases was not compensated for by population growth and cancer incidence rose
among Indigenous people across the same time period. Neither trend was statistically
significant (p<0.05).

The number of cancer deaths rose from 151 per year during the period 1991–1995 to 173 in
2001–2003. Despite the increase in number of cancer deaths, the cancer mortality rate
among non-Indigenous Territorians declined over time and the change was highly significant
(p<0.05). This phenomenon was not observed among Indigenous Territorians for whom the
all cancer death rate remained constant rate over time.

Lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the most common cause of
cancer death in the NT, declined in incidence and mortality among non-Indigenous
Territorians and Indigenous women. There was however, little reduction in lung cancer
incidence or death among Indigenous males, the group at highest risk.

Melanoma incidence among non-Indigenous Territorians was slightly lower than that of
Australia and remained fairly constant over time. The rate of death due to melanoma
declined markedly over time from 10 deaths per 100,000 population in the early 90s to one
death per 10000 in the early 2000s. Melanoma was a rare occurrence among Indigenous
Territorians.

For all NT women, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, the incidence and mortality of
cervical cancer decreased noticeably over the two periods. Whilst the rate of decline among
non-Indigenous women was similar to that of Australian women, the rate of decline in
incidence and mortality among Indigenous women was much greater, particularly for cervical
mortality.

In contrast to cervical cancer, the incidence of colorectal cancer and breast cancer among
Indigenous women increased considerably over time. The increase was statistically
significant for colorectal cancer. There was little change in the incidence of either cancer
among non-Indigenous or Australian women.

For all NT men prostate cancer also increased in incidence over time but there was a
marked reduction in mortality, particularly among Indigenous men.

Appendix 1 Additional statistical methods
For each death occurred to a person aged less than 75,
PYLL = 75 – age at death in year – 0.5

PYLL total = sum of PYLL of all deaths in a population group for a certain period (per annum)

PYLL rate = PYLL total / population * 100 000
(expressed as years-of-life-lost per 100 000 population)

Annual rate of change (%) = (irr – 1) x 100

Overall rate of change for n years (%) = (irr n-1 – 1) x 100
(irr is the incidence rate ratio, as provided by Negative binomial regression in STATA)
